### **Part 1: Lecture Notes (Vital for Midterm)**

#### **► What is Enterprise Architecture (EA)?**

Enterprise Architecture is the process of translating a company's business vision and strategy into a blueprint for effective change.

*   **Simple Definition:** Think of it as creating a master plan or a blueprint for the entire organization.
*   **Purpose:** It helps align business goals with technology to reduce costs, minimize risks, and increase value.
*   **Core Idea:** It defines the company's current state (**"Baseline"**) and its desired future state (**"Target"**), and creates a roadmap to get from one to the other.
    *   *Example:* Facebook (**Baseline**) rebranding to Meta (**Target**) to focus on the metaverse.
    *   *Example:* Toyota as a car manufacturer (**Baseline**) moving to become a "Mobility for All" company (**Target**).

#### **► Why is Enterprise Architecture Important?**

The business world is changing faster than ever, and EA is the tool to manage that change.

1.  **Managing Disruption:** New technologies like Cloud, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are changing markets. EA helps companies adapt and use these technologies effectively.
2.  **Market Leadership:** Companies that use EA well often become industry leaders.
    *   The presentation showed how tech-focused companies (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia) have overtaken older, resource-based companies in value. The key takeaway is that **"Mind is more expensive than resource."**
3.  **High Demand Skill:** According to Gartner, a leading research company, 60% of organizations will depend on Enterprise Architects to lead digital innovation. The Harvey Nash/KPMG survey also highlighted EA as a fast-growing and in-demand technology skill.
4.  **From VUCA to BANI:** The world has moved from being just Volatile and Complex (**VUCA**) to being Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, and Incomprehensible (**BANI**). EA provides the structure needed to operate in this new, more chaotic environment.

#### **► Course Goals & Expected Outcomes**

*   **Main Goal:** To introduce the fundamental concepts of Enterprise Architecture. The course will explain what EA is, why it's important, and how it connects a company's vision and strategy.
*   **What You Will Learn:**
    *   To understand and manage business complexity.
    *   To analyze and create architecture documents.
    *   To understand major EA frameworks like **TOGAF**.
    *   To develop soft skills like complex problem-solving and critical thinking, which are listed as top skills for 2025 by the World Economic Forum.
