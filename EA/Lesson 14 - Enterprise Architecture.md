### **Part 1: Lecture Notes (Vital for Exam & Career)**

#### **► Improving EA Maturity**
Building an EA practice is a journey. Companies use **Maturity Models** (like Gartner’s or CMMI) to assess where they are and where they need to go.

*   **The 5 Levels of EA Maturity:**
    1.  **Nonexistent / Planning:** No formal process. Ad-hoc.
    2.  **Reactive / Developing:** Initial deliverables, governance defined but not always followed.
    3.  **Functioning / Implementing:** Defined metrics, compliance is high, tools are used.
    4.  **Integrated / Managing:** EA process is repeatable and integrated with other business processes.
    5.  **Ubiquitous / Improving:** EA drives strategy and change. Continuous improvement.

#### **► Understanding Roles and Skills**
An Enterprise Architect is not just a "Senior Developer." It requires a mix of hard and soft skills.

*   **Key Roles in an EA Team:**
    *   **Architecture Board:** Approves architectures.
    *   **Sponsor:** Executive champion.
    *   **Domain Architects:** Specialists in Business, Data, Application, or Technology.
*   **Skill Categories (TOGAF Skills Framework):**
    1.  **Generic:** Leadership, teamwork, communication (selling the idea).
    2.  **Business:** Strategic planning, business case analysis.
    3.  **IT General Knowledge:** Asset management, migration planning.
    4.  **Technical IT:** Software engineering, security, data management.
    5.  **Legal:** Data protection, contract law.

#### **► Career Path**
*   **Certifications:** TOGAF 9 Certification is the gold standard for landing jobs at Big 4 (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, EY).
*   **Advice for aspiring Architects:**
    *   **Get Certified:** Shows you speak the language.
    *   **Get Smart:** Understand how technology *moves business forward* (not just tech for tech's sake).
    *   **Get in Front:** Demonstrate leadership. Architects often report to the CIO.

### **Part 2: Practice Session Notes (Visionary Case Studies)**

#### **1. Toyota Woven City (The Future of Mobility)**
*   **The Vision:** Toyota is transitioning from an "Automobile Company" to a **"Mobility Company."**
    *   *CEO Quote:* "Bringing the joy and freedom of movement to all."
*   **The Project:** **Woven City**.
    *   **What is it?** A prototype city built from scratch at the base of Mt. Fuji.
    *   **Purpose:** A real-world "living laboratory" to test autonomous vehicles, robotics, smart homes, and AI.
    *   **Why?** You cannot test the future of mobility in a lab. You need a real environment with real people. It connects **Phase B (Business Vision)** directly with **Phase D (Emerging Tech)**.

#### **2. The Walt Disney Company (Customer Experience)**
*   **MyMagic+ ($1 Billion Investment):**
    *   **Problem:** Declining customer satisfaction due to friction (lines, payments).
    *   **Solution:** The **MagicBand** (RFID wristband) + App.
    *   **Function:** Serves as a room key, ticket, wallet, and FastPass.
    *   **Architectural Win:** It acts as a massive **IoT** device collecting real-time data on guest movement. This allows Disney to optimize park operations and personalize experiences (e.g., Mickey Mouse saying "Happy Birthday, John!" because the sensor triggered the data).
*   **Streaming Wars (Disney+ vs. Netflix):**
    *   **Disney's Strategy:** "Content is King." They rely on high-quality, exclusive IP (Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar) rather than the massive volume strategy of Netflix.

### **Part 3: Final Course Summary (The "Big Picture")**

If you get a question about "What is Enterprise Architecture?", remember this flow:

1.  **Vision (Phase A):** Where are we going? (e.g., Toyota becomes a Mobility Company).
2.  **Business (Phase B):** How do we organize to get there? (e.g., Amazon Go business model).
3.  **Information Systems (Phase C):** What data and apps do we need? (e.g., Netflix's recommendation engine).
4.  **Technology (Phase D):** What infrastructure supports this? (e.g., AWS Cloud, RFID, IoT sensors).
5.  **Implementation (Phases E, F, G):** How do we build it and ensure it works? (Roadmaps, Governance).
6.  **Change (Phase H):** How do we keep it relevant? (Continuous improvement).
