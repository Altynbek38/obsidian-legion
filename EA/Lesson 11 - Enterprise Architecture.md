### **Lesson #11 - Governance, Change Management & Realisation (Phases G, H)**

This lesson covers the final stages of the ADM cycle: ensuring the project is built correctly (Governance) and managing changes over time. It also introduces the concept of Omnichannel through the Burberry case study.

### **Part 1: Lecture Notes (Vital for Exam)**

#### **► Phase G: Implementation Governance**
Once the plan is made (Phase F), the builders (developers, engineers) start working. Phase G is about **oversight**.

*   **Objective:** Ensure conformance. Make sure the implementation projects actually follow the Target Architecture defined in previous phases.
*   **Key Activity:** **Compliance Reviews**. The architect acts as a "building inspector," checking if the IT solution matches the architectural blueprint.
*   **Input/Output:**
    *   **Input:** Architecture Contract (signed document agreeing to the design).
    *   **Output:** Compliance Assessments.
*   **Motto:** "Under Control."

#### **► Phase H: Architecture Change Management**
Architecture is not a one-time project; it's a continuous cycle. Phase H manages what happens *after* the solution is live.

*   **Objective:** Ensure the architecture capability stays relevant.
*   **Types of Change:**
    1.  **Simplification:** Cleaning up.
    2.  **Incremental:** Small improvements.
    3.  **Re-architecting:** Starting the cycle again (Phase A) because the business strategy changed fundamentally.
*   **Why it's important:** Without Phase H, the architecture "rots" and becomes misaligned with the business over time.

#### **► The Realisation Iteration**
This is not a specific phase but a parallel process involving Project Management.
*   **Focus:** It happens alongside Phase G.
*   **Goal:** Provide architectural oversight while the solution is being deployed.
*   **Quote:** *"You want to see failure in development. You don't want to see failure in operation."* (Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX).

#### **► Requirements Management (The Center)**
*   It is **not** a phase (no specific order). It is a continuous process that feeds into all phases.
*   It ensures that stakeholder concerns are captured and addressed throughout the lifecycle.

### **Part 2: Practice Session Notes (Case Study: Burberry)**

*   **The Crisis (Baseline Architecture):**
    *   In the 70s-90s, Burberry diluted its brand through excessive licensing.
    *   It became associated with "gang culture" and mass-market cheap goods, losing its luxury status ("glitz and glam").
*   **The Transformation (Target Architecture):**
    *   **Vision:** Become the **"First fully digital luxury company"**.
    *   **Leadership:** Angela Ahrendts (CEO) and Christopher Bailey (Creative Director).
    *   **Strategy:**
        1.  **Purify the Brand:** Focus on the trench coat and British heritage.
        2.  **Target Youth:** Focus on millennials/Gen Z using digital channels.
        3.  **Content Company:** "Burberry is now as much a media-content company as we are a design company."
*   **Key Concept: Omnichannel vs. Multichannel**
    *   **Multichannel:** You have a store, a website, and an app, but they don't talk to each other (silos).
    *   **Omnichannel:** All channels are integrated. A customer can start buying on a phone and finish in the store. The experience is seamless.
    *   *Burberry Execution:* "Runway to Reality" (buy instantly from the fashion show livestream), iPads in stores, synchronized inventory.

### **Part 3: Assignment #05 - Answers**

*Note: This assignment requires synthesis of previous lessons (Amazon, Tech Arch) and current concepts.*

**Question 1: Why do you think that AR has a bright future comparing to VR even though there is a metaverse world behind VR? Please use VisionPro as an example.**

**AR (Augmented Reality)** has a brighter future because it integrates digital content into the physical world, enhancing daily life rather than replacing it. **VR (Virtual Reality)** isolates the user in a fully digital environment, limiting its use to specific sessions (gaming, simulation).
*   **VisionPro Example:** Apple’s Vision Pro focuses on **"Spatial Computing"** (Passthrough AR). It allows users to see their physical room while floating apps, screens, and models in front of them. This makes it applicable for work, collaboration, and daily tasks without losing connection to the real world/people, unlike the isolation of the VR Metaverse.

**Question 2: Please describe how Amazon GO works.**

Amazon Go stores use **"Just Walk Out"** technology, which combines three core technologies also found in autonomous vehicles:
1.  **Computer Vision:** Hundreds of ceiling cameras track the movement of every customer and item.
2.  **Sensor Fusion:** Weight sensors on the shelves confirm exactly when an item is picked up or put back.
3.  **Deep Learning:** Advanced algorithms process this data in real-time to build a "virtual cart." When the customer walks out, the system charges their Amazon account automatically.

**Question 3: Please describe Emerging Technologies in Technology Architecture (Phase D). Why is it important for companies to consider?**

**Emerging Technologies** (e.g., Generative AI, Neuromorphic Computing, Metaverse) are innovations identified during **Phase D (Technology Architecture)** that are not yet mainstream but hold disruptive potential.
*   **Importance:** Companies must consider them because technology is a **strategic driver**. If a company ignores emerging tech (Phase D), their Business Architecture (Phase B) risks becoming obsolete (e.g., Kodak ignoring digital cameras). Identifying these technologies early allows the enterprise to pivot and gain a competitive advantage (Phase E - Opportunities).

**Question 4: Why is there no meaning to apply ADM if there are no opportunities and solutions in Phase F ADM?**

*(Clarification: Opportunities are Phase E, Planning is Phase F).*
Applying ADM is meaningless without Phase F because **Phase F (Migration Planning)** is where the "Blueprint" becomes a "Project."
*   If you design a perfect architecture (Phases B, C, D) and identify solutions (Phase E) but fail to create a detailed **Implementation and Migration Plan (Phase F)** with budget, timeline, and resources, the architecture will never be built. It remains a theoretical document. Phase F ensures the architecture is integrated into the company's change portfolio and actually gets executed.
