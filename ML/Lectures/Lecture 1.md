### **Part 1: Course Outline and Administration**

#### **1.1 Participation and Grading**
*   **Participation Points:** You can earn 1 point per week by either uploading your lab work to Teams or by presenting your work during the practical class.
*   **Maximum Points:** A maximum of 10 points can be earned over the 14-week course.
*   **Attendance:** Simple attendance does *not* earn you any points.

#### **1.2 Exams**
*   **Mid-term:** A mix of multiple-choice questions (MCQ), open questions, and problems to solve.
*   **End-term:** A group project consisting of 2-4 students, which includes a 20-minute defense.
*   **Final Exam:** Will have the same format as the mid-term and will cover the entire program.

#### **1.3 Classroom Rules**
*   **Attendance:** Taken at the beginning or end of the lecture. If you are late, enter silently. If you need to leave, do so silently without asking for permission.
*   **Corrections & Extra Points:** The instructor will fix grading mistakes, but will not give extra points or extra tasks to students who ask for them, especially late in the semester. Points should be earned from the main assignments.
*   **Communication:** Be polite in your requests. Do not send the same message repeatedly if there is no immediate answer.

### **Part 2: Course Objectives and Outcomes**

*   **Main Objective:** To provide students with the fundamental knowledge and skills in modern data science and machine learning.
*   **Learning Outcomes:** By the end of the course, students will be able to:
    *   Describe various problems within the machine learning domain.
    *   Solve the mathematical problems that form the foundation of ML algorithms.
    *   Select, implement, and evaluate basic machine learning models.
    *   Be prepared for more advanced topics in machine learning.

### **Part 3: What is Machine Learning?**

#### **3.1 Definition**
Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on building computer systems that **learn from data** to make predictions. It is an interdisciplinary field that sits at the crossroads of:
*   **Mathematics:** (Linear Algebra, Calculus & Optimization)
*   **Statistics**
*   **Computer Science**

#### **3.2 The Machine Learning Process**
The typical workflow for a machine learning project is as follows:
1.  **Study the problem:** Understand the business objective.
2.  **Gather Data:** Collect the relevant data.
3.  **Train ML algorithm:** Feed the data to a suitable algorithm to create a model.
4.  **Evaluate solution:** Test the model's performance.
5.  **Analyze errors:** If the performance is not satisfactory, analyze the mistakes the model is making and return to the "Study the problem" phase to refine it.
6.  **Launch!** If the solution is good enough, deploy it.

### **Part 4: Applications of Machine Learning**
Machine learning is used to solve a wide variety of real-world problems, including:
*   **Image Classification:** Assigning a label to an image (e.g., identifying a mite, container ship, or leopard).
*   **Object Detection:** Identifying the location of multiple objects within a single image (e.g., finding a person, backpack, and trees in a photo).
*   **Action Recognition:** Classifying what action is being performed in an image or video (e.g., diving, golfing, lifting).
*   **Fraud Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns in data that may indicate fraudulent activity.
*   **Price Predictions:** Estimating a numerical value, such as the price of a used car based on its features.
*   **Mishandled Baggage Prediction:** Identifying factors that contribute to baggage being lost or delayed in an airport system.

### **Part 5: The Two Main Families of Machine Learning**

Machine learning is typically divided into two main categories:

#### **5.1 Supervised Learning (Predictive Approach)**
*   **Concept:** The algorithm learns from data that is **labeled**. This means that for each data input, the correct output is already known. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen data.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Labeled Data** is fed into the **Machine (algorithm)**.
    2.  The machine produces an **ML Model**.
    3.  The model is evaluated with **Test Data** to make **Predictions**.
*   **Sub-types:**
    *   **Classification:** Predicts a discrete category or class. (e.g., "Divide the socks by color").
    *   **Regression:** Predicts a continuous, numerical value. (e.g., "Divide the ties by length").

#### **5.2 Unsupervised Learning (Descriptive Approach)**
*   **Concept:** The algorithm learns from data that is **unlabeled**. There are no correct outputs provided. The goal is to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data itself.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Unlabeled Data** is fed into the **Machine (algorithm)**.
    2.  The machine analyzes the data and produces **Results** by grouping or organizing the data based on its internal structure.
*   **Sub-types:**
    *   **Clustering:** Groups similar data points together into clusters. (e.g., "Split up similar clothing into stacks").
    *   **Association:** Discovers rules that describe relationships between variables. (e.g., "Find what clothes I often wear together").
    *   **Dimension Reduction:** Reduces the number of variables in the data while retaining important information, often for generalization. (e.g., "Make the best outfits from the given clothes").
