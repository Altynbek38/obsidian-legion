**Key Constraints:**
*   **Data Type:** Must be **Tabular**. (No images, no time series, no datasets used previously in class).
*   **Deliverable:** A single **Jupyter Notebook** (no PDF/PPT). It must be readable "like a book," telling the story of your experiments.
*   **Code Quality:** High importance. Code must be modular (functions) and well-structured.
*   **Grading:** Competitive. Only the top 3 teams get 18-20 points; the rest are capped at 15. This means our EDA, feature engineering, and interpretation needs to be deeper than a standard assignment.

### Project Decomposition Plan

Based on the document, here is the step-by-step plan we will follow to build your notebook.

**Step 1: Problem Definition & Data Loading**
*   Clearly state the objective: What are we predicting and why?
*   Load the dataset and check basic info (rows, columns, data types).

**Step 2: Deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
*   *Requirement:* "Pay more attention to this part."
*   Univariate analysis (distribution of variables).
*   Bivariate analysis (correlations, relationships between features and the target).
*   Identify data quality issues (missing values, duplicates, outliers).

**Step 3: Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
*   *Requirement:* "Could you create new features from existing ones?"
*   Cleaning data (imputing missing values, removing duplicates).
*   Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables.
*   **Crucial:** Create new features (Feature Engineering) to improve model performance.

**Step 4: Model Experimentation (The "Trial and Error" Story)**
*   *Requirement:* Document iterations and reasoning.
*   Start with a baseline model.
*   Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
*   Perform Hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Important:** If a model fails, we must explain *why* (insufficient data, wrong assumptions, etc.).

**Step 5: Evaluation & Interpretation**
*   *Requirement:* Don't just report numbers; analyze residuals.
*   Select appropriate metrics (Accuracy, F1, RMSE, etc., depending on the problem).
*   **Residual Analysis:** Check where the model makes errors.
*   **Feature Importance:** Which features drove the decisions?

**Step 6: Final Conclusion & Code Refactoring**
*   Select the champion model.
*   Discuss limitations and future improvements.
*   **Refactor:** Ensure all code is modular (moved into functions) and the narrative flows smoothly.
