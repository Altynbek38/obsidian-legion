# 🧪 Network Security Testing Techniques

## **1. Operations Security (OpSec)**
**Operations Security** involves the day-to-day practices required to deploy and maintain a secure system.
*   **Lifecycle:** Starts during **Planning/Design** $\rightarrow$ Implementation $\rightarrow$ Operational Maintenance.
*   **Requirements:** Testing can be manual or highly automated.

**Required Skills for Testers:**
*   Operating Systems & Device Hardening.
*   Networking Protocols (TCP/IP).
*   Firewalls & IPS.
*   Basic Programming.
*   Vulnerability & Risk Mitigation knowledge.

## **2. Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E)**
Network security testing ensures protective measures work *before* a real threat occurs.

> [!info] **ST&E Definition**
> **Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E)** is an examination of protective measures on an **operational** network (after the system is developed, installed, and integrated).

**Objectives of ST&E:**
1.  **Uncover Flaws:** Find design or implementation errors violating security policy.
2.  **Determine Adequacy:** Ensure security mechanisms actually enforce the policy.
3.  **Assess Consistency:** Check if the system matches the documentation.

**Frequency:** Tests should be run **periodically** and **whenever a change is made**.

## **3. Reconnaissance Types**
Testers must think like threat actors using reconnaissance.

| Type | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Active Recon** | **Directly interacting** with network systems to gather info. | Port scanning, Pinging, Banner grabbing. |
| **Passive Recon** | **Indirectly learning** about the network without touching it. | OSINT, Social Media (Facebook), Dark Web leaks. |

## **4. Types of Network Tests**

| Test Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **⚔️ Penetration Testing** | **Simulates attacks** from malicious sources to test defense feasibility. Can include **Social Engineering** (physical access). |
| **📡 Network Scanning** | Detects listening TCP ports, available resources, usernames, and groups. |
| **🔍 Vulnerability Scanning** | Detects weaknesses: Misconfigurations, default passwords, DoS targets. |
| **🔐 Password Cracking** | Detects weak passwords that violate policy. |
| **📜 Log Review** | Analyzing system logs (often using filters) to discover abnormal activity. |
| **✅ Integrity Checkers** | Detects and reports changes to the **file system** or login activities. |
| **🦠 Virus Detection** | Antimalware tools to identify and remove malicious software. |
| **☎️ Legacy Tests** | **Wardialing** (modem scanning) and **Wardriving** (wireless searching). |

## **5. Applying Test Results**
Data from testing is not just for finding bugs; it is used strategically:
*   📉 **Define Mitigation:** Fix identified vulnerabilities.
*   📊 **Benchmark:** Trace progress in meeting security requirements.
*   💰 **Cost/Benefit Analysis:** Justify improvements.
*   📝 **Compliance:** Assess implementation status.
*   🏗️ **Reference:** A baseline for corrective actions.
