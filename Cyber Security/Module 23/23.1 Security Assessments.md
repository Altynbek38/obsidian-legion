## **1. Vulnerability Scanners**
A **vulnerability scanner** automates security auditing by scanning networks, computers, and apps for weaknesses. It produces a prioritized list of risks.

**What they detect:**
*   🔓 **Open ports** and active IP addresses.
*   🔑 **Default/Common passwords**.
*   🩹 **Missing patches** (OS & Software).
*   ⚙️ **Misconfigurations**.
*   📱 Unexpected devices.

**Common Tools:** `Nessus`, `Retina`, `Core Impact`, `GFI LanGuard`.

### **Types of Scanners**
| Type | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network Scanner** | Probes hosts for open ports, user groups, and known network vulnerabilities. |
| **App Scanner** | Accesses **source code** to test the application from the inside (does not run the app). |
| **Web App Scanner** | Identifies vulnerabilities specifically in web applications. |

## **2. Scan Methodologies**

### **Intrusiveness**
*   **Intrusive Scan:** Tries to **exploit** vulnerabilities. *Risk:* May crash the target system.
*   **Non-intrusive Scan:** Identifies vulnerabilities without exploitation. Safe for the target.

### **Access Level (Credentialed)**
| Type | Description | Pros/Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credentialed** | Uses valid usernames/passwords to log in. | ✅ More data, fewer errors.<br>✅ Detects internal config issues. |
| **Non-Credentialed** | Scans from the "outside" (Hacker's view). | ❌ Less deep.<br>❌ More false positives. |

### **Accuracy Terms**
*   **False Positive:** Scanner reports a vulnerability where **none exists**.
*   **False Negative:** Scanner **fails** to report an existing vulnerability.
> *Note: Credentialed scans significantly reduce both false positives and negatives.*

## **3. 💻 Command Line Diagnostic Tools**

Essential CLI tools for assessing security posture.

| Windows Command | Mac/Linux Equiv. | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ipconfig` | `ifconfig` | Displays TCP/IP settings (IP, Subnet, Gateway, MAC). |
| `ping` | `ping` | Tests connectivity via ICMP requests. |
| `tracert` | `traceroute` | Traces the route (hops) a packet takes to a destination. |
| `nslookup` | `dig` | Queries DNS servers to troubleshoot name resolution. |
| `arp` | `arp` | Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. |
| `netstat` | `netstat` | Displays active ports and connections. |
| `nbtstat` | *(n/a)* | Troubleshoots NetBIOS name resolution (Windows only). |
| `nmap` | `nmap` | **Security Auditing.** Locates hosts, detects OS, identifies services. |
| `netcat` | `nc` | Reads/writes to network connections (Port scanning, file copying). |
| `hping` | `hping` | Assembles/analyzes packets (Firewall testing, OS fingerprinting). |

## **4. 🤖 Security Automation (SIEM vs. SOAR)**

Automation is required to handle the massive volume of log data generated daily.

### **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
*   **Core Function:** **Aggregates logs** from various sources (firewalls, servers) and combines similar events to reduce data load.
*   **Goal:** Identifies deviations from the norm (anomalies) and patterns.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Identify internal/external threats.
    *   Monitor resource usage.
    *   Compliance reporting.
    *   Support incident response.

### **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)**
*   **Core Function:** Collects threat data and **responds** to low-level events **without human intervention**.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Threat & Vulnerability Management.
    *   Security Incident Response.
    *   **Automating** security operations.

> [!abstract] **Summary Difference**
> *   **SIEM** = **Detection & Logging** (Collecting data, finding the needle in the haystack).
> *   **SOAR** = **Action & Response** (Automatically fixing the issue or blocking the threat).
