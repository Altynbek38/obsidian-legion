## **2. Nmap & Zenmap**
**Nmap** is a public, low-level scanner used for mapping and reconnaissance. It runs on **Linux, Windows, and OS X**.

> [!abstract] **Key Capabilities**
> *   **Port Scanning:** Searches for services on a *single* host.
> *   **Port Sweeping:** Searches for the *same* service on *multiple* hosts.
> *   **🕵️‍♂️ Stealth Scans:** Harder to detect by target firewalls/IPS.
> *   **OS Fingerprinting:** Remotely identifies the Operating System.
> *   **Layer 3 Scanning:** Identifies protocols like GRE and OSPF.

> [!danger] **Decoy Mode**
> Nmap can use **decoy hosts** to mask the true source of a scan. This makes it a dual-use tool (Security Testing vs. Malicious Hacking).

## **4. SIEM (Security Information Event Management)**
**SIEM** combines **SIM** (Info Mgmt) and **SEM** (Event Mgmt) to provide real-time analysis. It can be software, hardware, or a managed service.

### **Core Functions**

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Correlation** | Links events from different systems to speed up threat detection. |
| **Aggregation** | Consolidates duplicate records to reduce data volume. |
| **Forensic Analysis** | Searchable logs allow deep dives into past events. |
| **Retention** | Long-term storage for reporting and compliance. |

### **Context Provided by SIEM**
SIEM adds context to alerts to answer "Who, What, Where?":
1.  **👤 User Info:** Name, location, auth status.
2.  **💻 Device Info:** MAC address, OS version, location.
3.  **🛡️ Posture Info:** Compliance status, AV version, patch level.
