Linux offers both graphical and command-line text editors. While graphical editors are user-friendly, command-line editors like **nano** are essential for remote administration via SSH, where no GUI is available. They are commonly used for editing system configuration files and performing maintenance tasks.

In Linux, everything — including devices and directories — is treated as a file. System settings are stored in **configuration files**, which are text files controlling how services and applications work. Users with proper permissions can edit these files using text editors. For example, the **/etc/hosts** file maps IP addresses to hostnames and can be edited with superuser privileges using the command:  
`sudo nano /etc/hosts`.
