**Linux is open source**- Any person can acquire Linux at no charge and modify it to fit specific needs. This flexibility allows analysts and administrators to tailor-build an operating system specifically for security analysis.

**The Linux CLI is very powerful -** While a GUI makes many tasks easier to perform, it adds complexity and requires more computer resources to run. The Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) is extremely powerful and enables analysts to perform tasks not only directly on a terminal, but also remotely.

**The user has more control over the OS -** The administrator user in Linux, known as the root user, or superuser, has absolute power over the computer. Unlike other operating systems, the root user can modify any aspect of the computer with a few keystrokes. This ability is especially valuable when working with low level functions such as the network stack. It allows the root user to have precise control over the way network packets are handled by the operating system.

**It allows for better network communication control -** Control is an inherent part of Linux. Because the OS can be adjusted in practically every aspect, it is a great platform for creating network applications. This is the same reason that many great network-based software tools are available for Linux only.
