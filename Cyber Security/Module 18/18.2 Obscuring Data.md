# 18.2.1: Introduction to Data Obscuring Techniques

#### Core Concept
This section introduces two methods used to hide or conceal data:
1.  **Data Masking:** Obscuring data to protect its sensitivity.
2.  **Steganography:** Hiding data within another file or message.

The goal is to understand these techniques to better secure an organization's information.

# 18.2.2: Data Masking Techniques

#### Core Concept
*   **Data Masking:** The process of replacing sensitive data with realistic but non-sensitive (**fictional**) data.
*   **Goal:** To protect the original, sensitive information while providing a usable and authentic-looking dataset for non-production purposes like software testing, development, or analysis. The masked data should still work with existing applications without requiring code changes.

#### Common Data Masking Techniques

| Technique | How it Works | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Substitution** | Replaces original data with random but plausible data from a pre-defined list. | Replacing real customer names like "John Smith" with fake names like "Robert Jones." |
| **Shuffling** | Randomly reorders the existing data within the same column. All the original data is still present, but it's disassociated from the correct record. | Taking a column of employee salaries and shuffling them, so the salary amounts are still present for testing, but they are no longer linked to the correct employee. |
| **Nulling Out** | Replaces the sensitive data with a `NULL` (empty) value, effectively deleting it from the non-production dataset. | Completely removing a Social Security Number column from a database used for testing. |

# 18.2.3: Steganography

#### Core Concept
*   **Steganography:** The art and science of **hiding data** within another, seemingly harmless file (the "cover" file).
*   **Cryptography vs. Steganography:**
    *   Cryptography **scrambles** a message to make it unreadable. The existence of the secret is obvious.
    *   Steganography **hides** a message's very existence. The goal is for no one to suspect a secret message is even there.

#### Technical Steganography (Digital)

*   **Key Terms:**
    *   **Embedded Data:** The secret message to be hidden.
    *   **Cover File:** The innocent-looking file used for concealment (e.g., an image, audio, or video file).
    *   **Stego File:** The final file, which is the cover file with the embedded data hidden inside.

*   **Common Technique: Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion**
    *   This method alters the **least significant bit (LSB)** of each color component (Red, Green, Blue) in the pixels of an image.
    *   These changes are so minor that they are **imperceptible to the human eye**.
    *   Each pixel can typically hide 3 bits of data (1 for R, 1 for G, 1 for B).

#### Social Steganography
*   **Concept:** Hiding information in plain sight using language with a hidden or secondary meaning that is only understood by the intended recipients.
*   **How it Works:** Relies on pre-arranged codes, slang, or obscure references.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Teens on social media using a phrase like "going to the movies" to actually mean "going to the beach."
    *   Using deliberate misspellings or inside jokes to convey a secret message while the apparent message seems normal to outsiders.

#### Detection (Steganalysis)
*   **Steganalysis:** The process of detecting and extracting hidden data from stego files.
*   **Detection Methods:**
    *   **Signature Analysis:** Using tools to scan for known patterns or signatures that steganography software leaves behind in file headers or unused data clusters.
    *   **Statistical Analysis:** Comparing the statistical properties of a suspected stego image to a normal image. Hidden data can sometimes create detectable, non-random patterns.
    *   **Visual Comparison:** If the original cover image is available, comparing it to the stego image can sometimes reveal subtle patterns or distortions.
