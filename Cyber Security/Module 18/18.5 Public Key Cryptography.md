# 18.5.1: Using Digital Signatures

#### Core Concept
A **Digital Signature** is a mathematical technique that uses **asymmetric cryptography** to provide three crucial security services for a message or file:
1.  **Authenticity:** Proves the identity of the sender.
2.  **Integrity:** Guarantees the data has not been altered.
3.  **Non-repudiation:** Provides legal proof that the sender actually sent the message, and they cannot deny it later.

#### Key Properties of a Digital Signature

| Property | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentic** | Cannot be forged; provides proof that only the legitimate signer could have created it. |
| **Unalterable** | The signed data cannot be modified after signing without invalidating the signature. |
| **Not Reusable**| The signature is unique to the specific data and cannot be copied and applied to a different document. |
| **Non-repudiable** | Acts as legally binding proof of the transaction, similar to a physical signature on paper. |

---
#### Common Use Cases

1.  **Code Signing:** Used to sign executable files and software. This verifies the identity of the publisher and ensures the software has not been infected with malware since it was signed.
2.  **Digital Certificates:** Used to authenticate the identity of a website (in HTTPS) or a user. They establish a trusted and encrypted connection.

#### Digital Signature Algorithms (DSS)
These are the standard algorithms used for creating and verifying signatures:

| Algorithm | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **DSA** (Digital Signature Algorithm) | The original U.S. government standard for digital signatures. |
| **RSA** (Rivest-Shamir Adleman) | A widely used asymmetric algorithm that can be used for both encryption and digital signatures. |
| **ECDSA** (Elliptic Curve DSA) | A modern, more efficient variant of DSA. It provides the same level of security but with **smaller key sizes and signatures**, which is ideal for mobile and low-power devices. |

# 18.5.2: Digital Signatures for Code Signing

#### Core Concept
**Code Signing** is the process of applying a digital signature to an executable file. This allows end-users to verify the software's authenticity and integrity before installation.

#### What Code Signing Guarantees
1.  **Authenticity:** The code genuinely comes from the stated publisher.
2.  **Integrity:** The code has not been altered or infected with malware since the publisher signed it.
3.  **Non-repudiation:** The publisher cannot deny that they released this specific piece of software.

#### How to Verify a Signed File (Windows Example)
You can inspect the digital signature of a file by viewing its properties.

1.  **File Properties:**
    *   Right-click the executable file and select `Properties`.

2.  **Digital Signatures Tab:**
    *   This tab lists the signatures applied to the file.
    *   You can see the **Name of the signer** (e.g., "CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.") and the **Digest algorithm** used (e.g., `sha256`).

3.  **Digital Signatures Details:**
    *   Clicking `Details` shows more information, including the exact **signing time**.
    *   It may also show a **Countersignature** from a Time Stamping Authority, which independently verifies *when* the signature was applied.

4.  **Certificate Information (General Tab):**
    *   Clicking `View Certificate` shows the details of the digital certificate that was used for signing.
    *   **Issued to:** The identity of the software publisher.
    *   **Issued by:** The Certificate Authority (CA) that verified the publisher's identity (e.g., DigiCert).
    *   **Valid from/to:** The validity period of the certificate. An invalid certificate will prevent the file from running.

5.  **Certificate Path:**
    *   This tab shows the **chain of trust**. It displays the certificate of the publisher, the intermediate CA that issued it, and the root CA at the top of the chain.
    *   A status of "This certificate is OK" confirms that the entire chain is trusted by your operating system.

# 18.5.3: Digital Signatures for Digital Certificates

#### Core Concepts
*   **Digital Certificate:** An electronic "ID card" or passport that proves your identity. It contains key information like:
    *   **Issued to:** The identity of the owner (e.g., Bob's website).
    *   **Issued by:** The Certificate Authority (CA) that verified the identity.
    *   **Validity Period:** The dates for which the certificate is valid.
    *   **Public Key:** The owner's public key.

*   **The Key Distinction:**
    | Component | Its Purpose |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | **Digital Certificate** | **Verifies Identity.** Proves *who you are*. It contains your public key. |
    | **Digital Signature** | **Verifies a Transaction.** Proves that a specific message or file came *from you* and was not altered. |

#### How it Works: The Complete Process (Bob sends a signed order to Alice)

##### Part 1: The Signing Process (Bob's Side)
1.  **Hash the Data:** Bob's computer takes the order confirmation (the data) and creates a **hash** of it.
2.  **Encrypt the Hash:** Bob's computer then encrypts this **hash** using **Bob's private key**.
3.  **Create the Signature:** This encrypted hash **is the digital signature**.
4.  **Append and Send:** The digital signature is attached to the original order confirmation, and the combined package is sent to Alice.

##### Part 2: The Verification Process (Alice's Side)
1.  **Separate:** Alice's computer receives the package and separates the order confirmation from the digital signature.
2.  **Decrypt the Signature:** It uses **Bob's public key** (obtained from Bob's digital certificate) to decrypt the signature. This reveals the original hash that Bob calculated (`Hash_A`).
3.  **Calculate a New Hash:** It takes the order confirmation data it received and calculates its own hash (`Hash_B`).
4.  **Compare:** It compares `Hash_A` to `Hash_B`.
    *   **If they match:** The signature is verified. This proves **authenticity** (it really came from Bob) and **integrity** (it was not changed in transit).
