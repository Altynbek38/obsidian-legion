### **Lab: Hashing Things Out**

#### **Objective:**
To use command-line tools (`openssl`, `sha256sum`) to generate cryptographic hashes and to understand their properties, primarily for verifying data integrity.

#### **Core Concepts:**
*   **Hashing:** A one-way function that takes any amount of data and produces a fixed-length string of characters (the "hash" or "digest").
*   **Integrity:** Hashing is used to verify that data has not been altered, corrupted, or tampered with.
*   **Avalanche Effect:** A critical property of secure hash functions where even a tiny change in the input data (like a single character) results in a completely different and unpredictable hash output.

### **Part 1: Hashing a Text File**

*   **Goal:** To generate a hash of a file and observe the avalanche effect after modifying the file.

#### **Key Commands:**

1.  **Generate a SHA-256 hash using `openssl`:**
    ```bash
    openssl sha256 letter_to_grandma.txt
    ```

2.  **Generate a SHA-256 hash using `sha256sum`:**
    ```bash
    sha256sum letter_to_grandma.txt
    ```

#### **Process & Findings:**
1.  A SHA-256 hash of the original `letter_to_grandma.txt` was calculated.
2.  The file was modified by changing a single character ("Grandma" to "Grandpa").
3.  A new SHA-256 hash of the modified file was calculated.
4.  **Result:** The second hash was **completely different** from the first, perfectly demonstrating the avalanche effect. This proves that hashes are extremely sensitive to any changes in the input data.

### **Part 2: Verifying Hashes**

*   **Goal:** To use a pre-computed hash to verify the integrity of a downloaded file. This is a very common real-world use case.

#### **Process & Findings:**
1.  **Examine the Provided Hash:** A signature file (`sample.img_SHA256.sig`) containing the *expected* hash value was viewed using the `cat` command.
    ```bash
    cat sample.img_SHA256.sig
    ```

2.  **Calculate the Local Hash:** The `sha256sum` command was used to calculate the *actual* hash of the downloaded file (`sample.img`).
    ```bash
    sha256sum sample.img
    ```

3.  **Compare the Hashes:** The hash output from `sha256sum` was visually compared to the hash value from the `.sig` file.

4.  **Result:** The hashes matched exactly. This confirms that the `sample.img` file was downloaded completely and without any errors or tampering. If the hashes had been different, it would indicate that the file was corrupt or had been maliciously altered.

### **Conclusion / Key Takeaway**

Cryptographic hashing is a fundamental tool for ensuring **data integrity**. By comparing the hash of a received file with a known, trusted hash from the source, one can be confident that the file has not been changed in transit.
