### **Lab: Determine the Encryption Algorithm to Use**

#### **Objective:**
To research and recommend appropriate encryption algorithms for three distinct scenarios: securing personal files, a home wireless network, and corporate site-to-site communications.

### **Part 1: Secure Personal Data**

*   **Scenario:** You need to protect a confidential text file on a shared computer.
*   **Method:** File-level encryption using an archiving tool.
*   **Tool Used:** `7-Zip`

#### **Key Findings & Recommendation:**
*   **General Encryption Standards:** When comparing symmetric algorithms, **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is the modern, secure standard. DES is obsolete and insecure, and 3DES is slow and being phased out.
*   **7-Zip Options:** When creating a `.zip` archive, 7-Zip provides two encryption methods:
    *   `ZipCrypto`: An older, weaker legacy algorithm.
    *   `AES-256`: A strong implementation of the AES standard.
*   **Recommendation:** Always choose **AES-256** for encryption in 7-Zip. It provides the strongest available protection for the file archive.

### **Part 2: Secure Wireless Data**

*   **Scenario:** Setting up a secure Wi-Fi network for a home with a mix of new (Wi-Fi 6) and older devices.
*   **Hardware:** Linksys Atlas Pro 6 (a modern mesh Wi-Fi system).

#### **Key Findings & Recommendation:**
*   **Available Security Options:** Modern routers like the Linksys Atlas Pro 6 typically offer:
    *   `WPA2 Personal`
    *   `WPA3 Personal`
    *   `WPA2/WPA3 Mixed Mode`
*   **Analysis:**
    *   `WPA2` is the long-standing, secure standard but is susceptible to certain attacks (like KRACK).
    *   `WPA3` is the latest and most secure standard, offering stronger protection against offline dictionary attacks and providing forward secrecy.
    *   `Mixed Mode` allows WPA3-capable devices to connect using the new standard while allowing older, WPA2-only devices to connect simultaneously.
*   **Recommendation:** The best choice is **WPA2/WPA3 Mixed Mode**. This provides the strongest possible security for modern devices (using WPA3) without sacrificing compatibility for older devices that can only use WPA2. If all devices were WPA3-compatible, `WPA3 Personal` would be the ideal choice.

### **Part 3: Secure Corporate Data Between Sites**

*   **Scenario:** Securing data traveling over the public internet between corporate sites using a site-to-site VPN.
*   **Technology:** **IPsec VPN** framework on Cisco ISR routers (IOS XE 17). IPsec combines algorithms for confidentiality (encryption) and integrity/authentication (hashing).

#### **Key Findings & Recommendation:**
*   **Supported IPsec Encryption Algorithms (Confidentiality):**
    *   DES (insecure)
    *   3DES (legacy)
    *   **AES** (with key sizes 128, 192, and **256 bits**)
*   **Supported IPsec Hashing Algorithms (Integrity/Authentication):**
    *   MD5 (insecure)
    *   SHA-1 (legacy)
    *   **SHA-2 Family (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)**
*   **Recommendation:** To ensure the highest level of protection for corporate data, you should recommend the strongest available algorithms:
    *   **Encryption:** **AES-256**
    *   **Hashing/Integrity:** **SHA-256** (or a higher variant like SHA-384/512)
