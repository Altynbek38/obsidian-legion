Of course. Here is a concise summary of the key commands and concepts from your steganography lab, formatted for easy review in Obsidian.

### **Lab: Use Steganography to Hide Data**

#### **Objective:**
To use the `steghide` command-line tool to embed a secret document (`.odt`) inside a common image file (`.jpg`), and then extract it, demonstrating the principles of steganography.

#### **Concept:**
Steganography is the art and science of hiding data within an ordinary, non-secret file or message (a "cover file") to avoid detection. Unlike cryptography, which scrambles a message's content, steganography hides the message's very existence.

### **Key Files & Tool**

*   **Tool:** `steghide` (a command-line steganography program).
*   **Cover File:** `keyboard.jpg` (The image that will carry the hidden data).
*   **Secret File:** `secret.odt` (The document that will be hidden inside the image).
*   **Passphrase:** `Cisco` (Used to encrypt and protect the hidden data).

### **Core `steghide` Commands**

#### **1. Embed Data (Hiding the File)**
This command embeds the secret file into the cover file.

```bash
# Syntax: steghide embed -cf <cover_file> -ef <embed_file>
steghide embed -cf keyboard.jpg -ef secret.odt
```
*   `-cf`: **C**over **F**ile (the image).
*   `-ef`: **E**mbed **F**ile (the secret document).

*Result:* The `keyboard.jpg` file is modified at the binary level, but its appearance and file size do not change noticeably. The original `secret.odt` remains untouched.

#### **2. Get Information (Verifying the Hidden Data)**
This command checks if a file contains embedded data and provides details about it.

```bash
# Syntax: steghide info <stego_file>
steghide info keyboard.jpg
```
*Result:* The output confirms that `secret.odt` is embedded, showing its size and that it is encrypted (using `rijndael-128`, which is AES).

#### **3. Extract Data (Revealing the File)**
This command extracts the hidden data from the cover file.

```bash
# Syntax: steghide extract -sf <stego_file>
steghide extract -sf keyboard.jpg
```
*   `-sf`: **S**tego **F**ile (the file containing the hidden data).

*Result:* After providing the correct passphrase (`Cisco`), the original `secret.odt` file is extracted and saved to the current directory.

### **Conclusion / Key Takeaway**

Steganography allows for covert communication by hiding data in plain sight within an innocuous carrier file, like an image. The `steghide` tool successfully embedded a document inside a JPG, and the only way to detect or retrieve the hidden data was to use the same tool with the correct passphrase. This makes it a powerful method for concealing information, as the existence of the secret message is not apparent to a casual observer.
