### **Lab: Classic & Modern Encryption Algorithms**

#### **Objective:**
To use the JCrypTool software to perform encryption and decryption with three different types of algorithms: classic (Caesar), modern symmetric (AES), and modern asymmetric (RSA).

---

### **Part 1: Classic Encryption (Caesar Cipher)**

*   **Concept:** A simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It uses the **same key** (the shift amount) for both encryption and decryption.
*   **Tool:** JCrypTool > Classic > **Caesar**

#### **Process:**
1.  **Encrypt:**
    *   **Message:** `CRYPTOGRAPHY IS FUN. CAN YOU READ THIS SECRET MESSAGE?`
    *   **Operation:** Encrypt
    *   **Alphabet:** Upper Latin (A-Z)
    *   **Key (Shift):** `K` (This corresponds to a numerical shift)
    *   **Result:** Ciphertext is generated in a new file.

2.  **Decrypt:**
    *   **Operation:** Decrypt
    *   **Key (Shift):** Use the same key (`K`) as encryption.
    *   **Result:** The original plaintext message is recovered.

*   **Key Takeaway:** Very simple to use but also very easy to break. The security relies solely on keeping the key (the shift amount) secret.

### **Part 2: Modern Symmetric Encryption (AES)**

*   **Concept:** A strong, modern block cipher that uses a **single secret key** for both encryption and decryption. The same key must be shared securely between the sender and receiver.
*   **Tool:** JCrypTool > Symmetric > **AES**

#### **Process:**
1.  **Encrypt:**
    *   **Operation:** Encrypt
    *   **Key Length:** 128-bit
    *   **Key (hex):** `AA 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 FF`
    *   **Mode:** ECB (Electronic Codebook)
    *   **Padding:** PKCS#5 Padding
    *   **Result:** A binary file (`.bin`) containing the hexadecimal ciphertext is created.

2.  **Decrypt:**
    *   **Operation:** Decrypt
    *   **Settings:** Use the **exact same key and settings** as encryption.
    *   **Result:** The original plaintext is recovered.

*   **Key Takeaway:** AES is the industry standard for symmetric encryption. It is very fast and secure. The main challenge is securely sharing the single key.

### **Part 3: Modern Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)**

*   **Concept:** Uses a mathematically linked **key pair**: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption. The public key can be shared freely, while the private key must be kept secret by the owner.
*   **Tool:** JCrypTool > Asymmetrical > **RSA**

#### **Process:**
1.  **Create Key Pair:**
    *   Go to the RSA tool settings.
    *   Select `Create a new pair in the keystore`.
    *   **Contact name:** `John Smith`
    *   **Password:** `Secret` (This password protects the private key).

2.  **Encrypt:**
    *   **Operation:** Encrypt
    *   **Keystore:** Select the newly created "John Smith" key pair. JCrypTool automatically uses the **public key** for encryption.
    *   **Result:** A binary file containing the encrypted ciphertext is created.

3.  **Decrypt:**
    *   **Operation:** Decrypt
    *   **Keystore:** Select the "John Smith" key pair. JCrypTool will use the **private key**.
    *   **Password:** Enter `Secret` to unlock the private key.
    *   **Result:** The original plaintext is recovered.

*   **Key Takeaway:** RSA solves the key exchange problem of symmetric encryption. Anyone can encrypt a message for you with your public key, but only you can decrypt it with your secret private key.
