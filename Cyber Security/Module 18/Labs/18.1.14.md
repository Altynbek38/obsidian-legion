### **Lab: Examining Telnet and SSH in Wireshark**

#### **Objective:**
To visually demonstrate the critical security difference between the unencrypted Telnet protocol and the encrypted SSH protocol by capturing and analyzing their respective session data in Wireshark.

### **Part 1: Analyzing a Telnet Session**

*   **Process:**
    1.  Start a Wireshark capture on the `Loopback: lo` interface.
    2.  In a new terminal, initiate a Telnet session to the local machine:
        ```bash
        telnet localhost
        ```
    3.  Log in with a username and password (`analyst` / `cyberops`).
    4.  Stop the Wireshark capture.

*   **Analysis in Wireshark:**
    1.  Apply the display filter: `telnet`
    2.  Right-click on a Telnet packet and choose **Follow > TCP Stream**.

*   **Key Finding:**
    The "Follow TCP Stream" window displays the **entire session in plaintext**. The username, password, and all commands are clearly visible and readable. This proves Telnet offers **zero confidentiality**.

### **Part 2: Analyzing an SSH Session**

*   **Process:**
    1.  Start a new Wireshark capture on the `Loopback: lo` interface.
    2.  In a terminal, initiate an SSH session to the local machine:
        ```bash
        ssh localhost
        ```
    3.  Accept the host key fingerprint and log in with the same credentials.
    4.  Stop the Wireshark capture.

*   **Analysis in Wireshark:**
    1.  Apply the display filter: `ssh`
    2.  Right-click on an SSH packet and choose **Follow > TCP Stream**.

*   **Key Finding:**
    The "Follow TCP Stream" window displays the session data as **unreadable, garbled text**. This is the encrypted payload. It is impossible to discern the username, password, or any commands from the captured data. This proves SSH provides strong **confidentiality** through encryption.

### **Conclusion / Reflection**

**Why is SSH preferred over Telnet for remote connections?**

SSH is vastly preferred because it **encrypts the entire communication session**. This includes the authentication process (username and password) and all data exchanged after logging in. Telnet, by contrast, sends all information in **clear text**, making it extremely vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Anyone who can capture the network traffic can steal credentials and monitor the entire session. For this reason, Telnet is considered obsolete and insecure for remote management.
