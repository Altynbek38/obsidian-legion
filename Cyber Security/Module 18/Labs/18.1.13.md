### **Lab: Encrypting and Decrypting Data using a Hacker Tool**

#### **Objective:**
To demonstrate the relationship between password length and the time required to crack it. This is achieved by creating password-protected zip files with increasing password lengths and then using a brute-force tool (`fcrackzip`) to recover the passwords.

---

### **Part 1: Creating Password-Protected Zip Files**

*   **Goal:** Create a series of zip archives, each protected by a password of a specific length (1 character, 2 characters, etc.).
*   **Tool:** The standard Linux `zip` utility.

#### **Key Commands:**

1.  **Create a directory and files:**
    ```bash
    mkdir Zip-Files
    cd Zip-Files
    echo "This is a sample text file" > sample-1.txt
    # (repeat for sample-2.txt, sample-3.txt)
    ```

2.  **Create an encrypted zip file:**
    *   The `-e` flag tells `zip` to **e**ncrypt the archive. You will be prompted to enter and verify a password.

    ```bash
    # Syntax: zip -e <archive_name.zip> <files_to_include>
    zip -e file-1.zip sample*
    ```

*   **Process:** This process was repeated to create `file-1.zip` through `file-6.zip`, using passwords of 1 through 6 characters respectively.

### **Part 2: Recovering Passwords with `fcrackzip`**

*   **Goal:** Use a brute-force attack to discover the passwords for the encrypted zip files.
*   **Tool:** `fcrackzip`, a command-line tool designed to crack zip file passwords.

#### **Key Command & Options:**

```bash
# Syntax: fcrackzip [options] <file_to_crack.zip>
fcrackzip -v -u -l <min-max_length> file-1.zip
```
*   **Command Breakdown:**
    *   `fcrackzip`: The program name.
    *   `-v`: **V**erbose mode (shows more detailed output).
    *   `-u`: **U**se `unzip` to double-check the found password (improves reliability).
    *   `-l <min-max>`: Specifies the password **l**ength range to test (e.g., `-l 1-4` tests all passwords from 1 to 4 characters long).

#### **Lab Results & Observations:**

The primary goal of the lab is to observe the time it takes to crack passwords of different lengths.

*   **1-character password (`-l 1-1`):** Cracked almost instantly.
*   **2-character password (`-l 2-2`):** Cracked in seconds.
*   **3-character password (`-l 3-3`):** Takes noticeably longer than the 2-character password.
*   **4-character password (`-l 4-4`):** Takes significantly more time, often several seconds to a minute.
*   **5 & 6-character passwords (`-l 5-6`):** The time required increases exponentially. Cracking these can take many minutes, hours, or even longer depending on the password complexity and CPU speed.

### **Conclusion / Key Takeaway**

**Password length is the most critical factor in resisting brute-force attacks.** Each additional character added to a password exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, and therefore dramatically increases the time required to crack it. While complexity (using upper/lower case, numbers, symbols) also helps, length provides the greatest security benefit against this type of attack.
