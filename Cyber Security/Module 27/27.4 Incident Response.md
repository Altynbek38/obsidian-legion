# 🚨 Incident Response (IR)

## **1. Establishing Capability**
**Incident Response** involves methods, policies, and procedures to respond to a cyberattack.
*   **Goals:** Limit impact, assess damage, implement recovery.
*   **Key Standard:** **NIST 800-61r2** ("Computer Security Incident Handling Guide").

### **CSIRC (Computer Security Incident Response Capability)**
An organization needs to establish a CSIRC with three core components:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **📜 Policy** | **The Rules.** Details *how* incidents are handled based on mission/size. Includes management commitment, roles, and severity ratings. |
| **🗺️ Plan** | **The Strategy.** Minimizes damage. Includes mission, communication methods, and metrics. |
| **⚙️ Procedures** | **The Steps.** Standard Operating Procedures (**SOPs**), technical processes, and checklists. |

## **2. Stakeholders & CMMC**

### **Who is involved?**
*   **CSIRT:** Computer Security Incident Response Team.
*   **Management:** Budget and Staffing.
*   **IT Support:** Technical understanding/evidence preservation.
*   **Legal:** Reviews policies for laws/prosecution.
*   **Public Affairs:** Media relations.
*   **HR:** Employee discipline.
*   **Physical Security:** Securing facilities/evidence.

### **CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)**
*   **Purpose:** Assesses **DoD (Dept of Defense)** contractors' ability to protect the supply chain.
*   **Structure:** 17 Domains. **5 Maturity Levels** (Level 1 = Basic, Level 5 = Advanced/Optimized).

## **3. The NIST Incident Response Life Cycle**
A self-reinforcing learning process.

> **Cycle:** Preparation $\to$ Detection & Analysis $\to$ Containment, Eradication, & Recovery $\to$ Post-Incident Activity.

### **Phase 1: Preparation**
*   **Action:** Train CSIRT, acquire tools, set up facilities.
*   **Prevention:** Risk assessments, user awareness, hardening.
*   **Jump Kit:** A portable bag containing laptops, backup media, sniffers, and software ready for immediate deployment.

### **Phase 2: Detection and Analysis**
*   **Difficulty:** Often the hardest phase.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Web, Email, Loss/Theft, Impersonation, Attrition (Brute Force), Media (USB).

> [!important] **Signs of an Incident**
> *   **Precursor:** A sign an incident *might* occur in the future (e.g., Log entry of a port scan).
> *   **Indicator:** A sign an incident *has* occurred or is occurring (e.g., Antivirus alert, buffer overflow).

*   **Scoping:** Determine the extent of the impact.
*   **Notification:** Inform stakeholders (CIO, Legal, US-CERT, etc.).

### **Phase 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
*   **Containment:** Stop the spread.
    *   *Strategy:* Must be decided *before* the incident.
    *   *Warning:* Do not always unplug/shutdown immediately; it might trigger data wipes or lose RAM evidence.
*   **Evidence:** Maintain **Chain of Custody** (Who handled it, when, where).
*   **Eradication:** Remove malware, delete compromised accounts, patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Recovery:** Restore from clean backups, change passwords, monitor for re-infection.

### **Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity**
*   **"Lessons Learned" Meeting:** Critical step.
*   **Questions:** What happened? Did procedures work? What information was missing?
*   **Goal:** Improve future responses and harden security.

## **4. Data Collection & Retention**

### **Assessment Types**
*   **Objective:** Reviewing logs, calculating monetary damage (Facts).
*   **Subjective:** Assessing team performance and efficiency (Opinions).

### **Evidence Retention Factors**
1.  **Prosecution:** Keep until all legal action is complete (could be years).
2.  **Data Type:** Email (short term) vs. Incident Reports (long term).
3.  **Cost:** Storage of hardware/media can be expensive.

### **Information Sharing**
*   **Internal:** Legal, Management, HR.
*   **External:** **VERIS** Community Database, US-CERT.
*   *NIST Recommendation:* Coordinate with external parties *before* incidents occur and automate sharing where possible.
