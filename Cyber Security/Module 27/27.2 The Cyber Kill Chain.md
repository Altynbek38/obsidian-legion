# ⛓️ The Cyber Kill Chain

## **1. Overview**
Developed by **Lockheed Martin**, the Cyber Kill Chain identifies 7 steps adversaries takes to accomplish their goal.

*   **Objective:** Detect and stop the attack **as early as possible**.
*   **"Breaking the Chain":** Stopping the attacker at *any* stage thwarts the intrusion.
*   **Success:** Attackers are only successful if they complete **Step 7**.

> [!info] **Terminology**
> **"Threat Actor"** and **"Adversary"** are used interchangeably in this model.

## **The 7 Steps of the Kill Chain**

### **1. 👁️ Reconnaissance**
*Researching, gathering intelligence, and selecting targets.*
*   **Adversary Tactics:**
    *   Harvesting emails & social media info.
    *   Discovering internet-facing servers.
    *   **Port Scanning** (identifying IPs/Open ports).
*   **SOC Defense:**
    *   Analyze web logs for historical searching.
    *   Data mine browser analytics.
    *   Prioritize defense around people/tech being targeted.

### **2. 💣 Weaponization**
*Pairing remote malware with a backdoor (exploit) to create a **payload**.*
*   **Adversary Tactics:**
    *   Creating a "Zero-day" attack (unknown to defenders).
    *   Building a backdoor and Command & Control (CnC) infrastructure.
*   **SOC Defense:**
    *   **Malware Analysis.**
    *   Update IDS rules/signatures.
    *   Collect artifacts to associate with specific campaigns.

### **3. 📦 Delivery**
*Transmitting the weapon to the victim.*
*   **Adversary Tactics:**
    *   **Direct:** Attacks against web servers.
    *   **Indirect:** Phishing emails, malicious USBs, social media links, compromised websites.
*   **SOC Defense:**
    *   Analyze delivery paths.
    *   Collect email/web logs.
    *   Infer intent based on *who* is targeted.

### **4. 💥 Exploitation**
*Triggering the code to exploit a vulnerability and gain access.*
*   **Adversary Tactics:**
    *   Exploiting **Software/Hardware** vulnerabilities.
    *   Exploiting **Human** vulnerabilities (phishing clicks).
*   **SOC Defense:**
    *   **User Training** (Security Awareness).
    *   Secure coding & Hardening endpoints.
    *   Regular Vulnerability Scanning & Pen Testing.

### **5. 🚪 Installation**
*Establishing a backdoor (persistence) to maintain access.*
*   **Adversary Tactics:**
    *   Installing **Webshells**.
    *   Modifying **AutoRun** registry keys.
    *   Time-stomping (modifying timestamps to hide malware).
*   **SOC Defense:**
    *   **HIPS** (Host Intrusion Prevention System).
    *   Auditing endpoints for abnormal file creation.
    *   Checking for privilege escalation requirements.

### **6. 📡 Command & Control (CnC / C2)**
*Establishing a communication channel to manipulate the target remotely.*
*   **Adversary Tactics:**
    *   Beaconing out to the internet.
    *   Using **DNS**, **HTTP**, or **IRC** protocols.
*   **SOC Defense:**
    *   **DNS Isolation** (Sinkholing suspect domains).
    *   Blocking CnC protocols on proxies.
    *   Analyzing malware to find infrastructure links.

### **7. 🏁 Actions on Objectives**
*Achieving the original goal ("Hands on Keyboard").*
*   **Adversary Tactics:**
    *   **Lateral Movement** (moving through the network).
    *   Data Exfiltration or Corruption.
    *   Encryption (Ransomware) or DDoS.
    *   Privilege Escalation.
*   **SOC Defense:**
    *   **Incident Response** Playbooks.
    *   Forensic analysis of endpoints.
    *   Network packet captures (recreating activity).
