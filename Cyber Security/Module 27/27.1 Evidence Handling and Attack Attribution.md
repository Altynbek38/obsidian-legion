# **Evidence Handling and Attack Attribution**

## **Digital Forensics**
**Digital forensics** is the recovery and investigation of information found on digital devices related to criminal activity.

*   **Indicators of Compromise (IOC):** Evidence that an incident occurred (data on storage, volatile memory, logs, pcaps).
*   **Goal:** Identify threat actors, report to authorities, and provide prosecution evidence.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Internal:** Policy violations, theft of IP (Private investigation).
    *   **External:** Data breaches, exploits (Public/Law enforcement investigation).
*   **Compliance:** Regulations (e.g., HIPAA) require forensic certification of the number of affected individuals for breach notifications.

## **The Digital Forensics Process (NIST 800-86)**
NIST recommends a four-phase process for forensics.

| Phase | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Collection** | Identify sources; acquire, handle, and store data. **Critical:** Do not damage or omit data. |
| **2. Examination** | Assess and extract relevant info (decrypt, decompress). Filter out irrelevant data. |
| **3. Analysis** | Draw conclusions from data. Document people, places, times, events. Correlate sources. |
| **4. Reporting** | Present findings impartially. Include limitations, alternative explanations, and next steps. |

## **Types of Evidence**

| Type | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Evidence** | Indisputably in possession of the accused or eyewitness testimony. |
| **Indirect Evidence** | (Circumstantial) Establish a hypothesis when combined with other facts. |
| **Best Evidence** | Evidence in its **original state** (e.g., original storage drives). |
| **Corroborating Evidence** | Supports an assertion developed from best evidence. |

## **Evidence Collection Order (Volatility)**
According to **IETF RFC 3227**, evidence must be collected from **Most Volatile** to **Least Volatile** (as data is lost when power is cut).

**Collection Priority:**
1.  **Memory Registers, Caches** (Most Volatile)
2.  **RAM** (Routing tables, ARP cache, process tables, kernel stats)
3.  **Temporary File Systems**
4.  **Non-volatile Media** (Fixed and removable disks)
5.  **Remote Logging/Monitoring Data**
6.  **Physical Interconnections/Topologies**
7.  **Archival Media** (Backups, tapes) (Least Volatile)

## **Chain of Custody**
A rigorous process to prove evidence was not altered or fabricated after collection. Records must include:
*   **Who** discovered/collected it.
*   **Handling details** (times, places, personnel).
*   **Transfer of custody** (who accepted responsibility and when).
*   **Storage access** (restricted to essential personnel only).

---

## **Data Integrity & Preservation**
*   **Golden Rule:** **Never analyze the original.** Always create a direct bit-level copy and analyze the copy.
*   **Hashing:** Compare the hash of the original disk vs. the copy to prove integrity.
*   **Live Systems:** Do not turn off infected machines unless instructed (loss of RAM evidence). Use special tools to capture volatile memory first.

---

## **Attack Attribution**
Determining the individual, organization, or nation responsible for an attack.

*   **TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):** Incident response teams correlate TTPs from the attack with known exploits.
*   **Internal Threats:** Use Asset Management (IPs, MACs, DHCP logs) and AAA logs to track activity to a specific device/user.
*   **Challenge:** Attribution is often circumstantial (based on code features, tools used, originating domains).

---

## **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
A global knowledge base of threat actor behavior based on real-world observations. It maps the attack lifecycle.

*   **Tactics:** The **Technical Goals** (What the attacker wants to achieve).
*   **Techniques:** The **Means** (How the tactic is accomplished).
*   **Procedures:** The **Specific Actions** taken by the actor.

*Used for:* Threat defense, attack attribution, and automated information sharing.
