# 📝 Digital Forensics, Incident Response & Analysis Summary

## **1. Digital Forensics & Attribution**

*   **Definition:** Recovery/Investigation of data from digital devices related to crime.
*   **Process (NIST 800-86):** Collection $\to$ Examination $\to$ Analysis $\to$ Reporting.
*   **Collection Priority (RFC 3227):** Collect based on **volatility** (RAM first, Archives last).
*   **Chain of Custody:** Secure collection, handling, and storage of evidence.

### **Attribution**
*   **Goal:** Identify the threat actor (Individual/Group/Nation).
*   **Method:** Correlate **TTPs** (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) with known exploits.
*   **Framework:** **MITRE ATT&CK** helps map TTPs for defense and attribution.

## **2. The Cyber Kill Chain**
Developed by Lockheed Martin. Stopping the attack at *any* stage breaks the chain.

| Step | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Reconnaissance** | Gathering intel and selecting targets. |
| **2. Weaponization** | Creating the payload (Exploit + Backdoor). |
| **3. Delivery** | Transmitting the weapon (Email, USB, Web). |
| **4. Exploitation** | Triggering the code to gain access. |
| **5. Installation** | Establishing a backdoor (Persistence). |
| **6. Command & Control** | Establishing a remote communication channel. |
| **7. Actions on Objectives** | Achieving the goal (Theft, Encryption/Ransomware, Destruction). |

## **3. The Diamond Model**
Represents an intrusion **event** (time-bound activity).

**Core Features (The 4 Corners):**
*   **Adversary:** Who is attacking.
*   **Capability:** What tool is used.
*   **Infrastructure:** What network path is used.
*   **Victim:** Who is targeted.

> **Meta-Features:** Timestamp, Phase, Result, Direction, Methodology, Resources.
> **Pivot:** Analysts use the model to link events across different threads.

## **4. Incident Response (IR)**
**Goal:** Limit impact, assess damage, and recover.

**Key Standard:** **NIST 800-61r2** (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide).

### **NIST IR Life Cycle**
1.  **Preparation:** Training, Tools, Policy, Jump Kits.
2.  **Detection & Analysis:** Identifying Precursors and Indicators. Scoping the incident.
3.  **Containment, Eradication, & Recovery:** Stopping the spread, removing threats, restoring data.
4.  **Post-Incident Activity:** "Lessons Learned" meeting to harden security.

### **CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)**
*   Required for **DoD** contractors.
*   **5 Maturity Levels** (Basic to Advanced).
*   Assesses ability to protect the supply chain.

## **5. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**

*   **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** Activities to restore **IT Systems** during a disaster.
    *   *Controls:* Preventive, Detective, Corrective.
*   **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** Activities to keep the **Business** running (even at alternate sites).
    *   *Analysis:* **BIA** (Business Impact Analysis).

**Key Metrics:**
*   **RTO:** Max tolerable downtime.
*   **RPO:** Max acceptable data loss.
*   **MTTR:** Mean time to repair.
*   **MTBF:** Mean time between failures.

**Testing Methods:**
*   **Tabletop:** Discussion only.
*   **Functional:** Testing specific parts.
*   **Operational:** Full simulation (Service interruption).
