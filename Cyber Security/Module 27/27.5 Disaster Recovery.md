# 🌪️ Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

## **1. Types of Disasters**
Any event that damages assets/property and impairs operations.

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌋 Natural** | **Geological:** Earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes.<br>**Meteorological:** Hurricanes, tornadoes, snowstorms.<br>**Health:** Pandemics, quarantines.<br>**Misc:** Fires, floods, solar storms. |
| **🏗️ Human-Caused** | **Labor:** Strikes, walkouts.<br>**Sociopolitical:** Sabotage, terrorism, war, protests.<br>**Materials:** Hazardous spills.<br>**Utility:** Power failure, communication outage. |

## **2. Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**
Activities to assess, salvage, repair, and restore damaged facilities/assets **during** a disaster.

*   **Key Question:** What are the most **Critical Systems**? (Prioritize restoring these first).
*   **DRP Controls:**
    *   **🛑 Preventive:** Identify and mitigate risks to prevent disaster.
    *   **🔍 Detective:** Uncover new threats/unwanted events (e.g., Alarms).
    *   **🛠️ Corrective:** Restore systems *after* the event.

## **3. Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**
A broader plan than DRP. Focuses on **keeping the business running**, potentially at an alternate location, until normal operations resume.

### **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**
The first step of BCP. Identifies critical processes and the consequences of interruption.

**Key Metrics:**
*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum tolerable downtime.
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss (measured in time, e.g., "loss of 1 hour of data").
*   **MTTR (Mean Time To Repair):** Average time to fix a failed component.
*   **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** Average time between one failure and the next.

> [!important] **NIST Best Practices for BCP:**
> 1.  Develop Policy.
> 2.  Conduct BIA.
> 3.  Calculate Risk.
> 4.  Identify Preventive Controls.
> 5.  Develop Recovery Strategies.
> 6.  Develop Contingency Plan.
> 7.  **Test the Plan.**
> 8.  Maintain/Update the Plan.

## **4. Testing the Plan**
You must train staff and test the DRP/BCP to ensure it works.

| Test Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🗣️ Tabletop Exercise** | **Discussion-based.** Staff sit around a table and discuss a scenario. No actual systems are touched. |
| **🔧 Functional Test** | Testing specific aspects of a plan to see if they work (e.g., restoring a backup). |
| **🚨 Operational Exercise** | **Full Simulation.** Interrupting services to simulate a real disaster. |
