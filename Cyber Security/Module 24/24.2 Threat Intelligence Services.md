## **2. Communication Standards (The "Language")**
To share intelligence automatically across different platforms, specific open standards are used.

> [!abstract] **The Standards Trio**
> *   **📦 STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression):**
>     The **Specification**. It defines *what* the threat info looks like (the file format). Includes CybOX.
> *   **🚚 TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information):**
>     The **Transport**. It defines *how* to send the info (Application layer protocol over HTTPS). Designed to carry STIX.
> *   **🔬 CybOX (Cyber Observable Expression):**
>     The **Schema**. Standardizes how to describe events/properties (e.g., a file hash, an IP, a registry key). Now incorporated into STIX.

### **Open Source Platforms**
*   **🇪🇺 MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform):**
    *   Open-source platform supported by the **EU**.
    *   Used by 6,000+ orgs to share **IOCs** (Indicators of Compromise).
    *   Uses STIX formats.

## **3. Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP)**

**Problem:** Too many data sources with different formats.
**Solution:** **TIP** centralizes and aggregates data into a readable format.

**Three Main Data Types Aggregated:**
1.  **IOCs:** Indicators of Compromise.
2.  **TTPs:** Tools, Techniques, and Procedures.
3.  **Reputation:** Scores for domains/IPs.

### **🍯 Honeypots**
*   **Definition:** Simulated networks/servers designed to **attract attackers**.
*   **Purpose:** Observe attacker behavior to gather intelligence.
*   **Best Practice:** Host honeypots in the **Cloud** to isolate them from the production network.
