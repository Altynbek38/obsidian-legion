# ⚖️ Risk Assessment

## **1. Threat Sources**
Threat assessment is the foundation of risk assessment.
*   **Threat:** Potential for a vulnerability to be exploited.
*   **Threat Vector:** The path used to attack.

| Source Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **⚔️ Adversarial** | Malicious intent from individuals, groups, or nations. |
| **⚠️ Accidental** | Actions without malicious intent (Human error). |
| **🏗️ Structural** | Equipment or software failures. |
| **🌪️ Environmental** | Disasters (natural or human-caused) like fire/flood. |

## **2. Risk Analysis Approaches**
The goal is to balance the **impact of the threat** against the **cost of the countermeasure**.

### **A. Quantitative Analysis (The Math)**
Assigns specific numbers (monetary value) to risk.

> [!important] **Key Formulas**
> *   **Asset Value:** Replacement cost or income gained from the asset.
> *   **EF (Exposure Factor):** % of asset lost due to a threat (0% to 100%).
> *   **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy):** Cost of a single event.
>     $$SLE = Asset\ Value \times EF$$
> *   **ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence):** How often it happens per year.
> *   **ALE (Annual Loss Expectancy):** The total yearly cost.
>     $$ALE = SLE \times ARO$$

*   **Usage:** Used to justify budgets. If the **ALE** is higher than the cost of protection, buy the protection.

### **B. Qualitative Analysis (The Opinion)**
Uses opinions and scenarios rather than hard numbers.
*   **Method:** Plots **Likelihood** vs. **Impact**.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Risk Matrix / Heat Map:** Color-coded grid (e.g., Red = Critical, Green = Negligible).
    *   **Scale:** Low, Medium, High, Critical.

## **3. Risk Mitigation Strategies**
Mitigation involves reducing the **likelihood** or **severity** of a loss.

| Strategy | Action | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **✅ Accept** | Acknowledge the risk; periodically reassess. | Creating a contingency plan but taking no immediate action. |
| **⬇️ Reduce** | Implement controls to lower risk. | Patching software, installing firewalls. |
| **🛑 Avoid** | Change the approach entirely. | Discontinuing a specific risky service. |
| **🤝 Transfer** | Shift risk to a 3rd party. | Buying **insurance** or outsourcing (SECaaS). |

## **4. Asset Prioritization**
Assets should be prioritized based on the **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)**. The higher the potential financial loss, the higher the priority for protection.

**Ranking Logic (Example):**
1.  **Highest Priority:** High ALE (e.g., Webserver Attack = $1,000,000/year).
2.  **Medium Priority:** Medium ALE (e.g., Database Failure = $1,250/year).
3.  **Lowest Priority:** Low ALE (e.g., Laptop Theft = $500/year).
