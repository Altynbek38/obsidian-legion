# 🛡️ Security Controls

## **1. Control Types (The "What")**
**Security Controls** are safeguards implemented to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize risks. They fall into three main categories:

| Type | Focus | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **📋 Administrative** | **People** | Policies, procedures, and rules. Determines *how* people act. |
| **💻 Technical** | **IT Systems** | Hardware and software implementations (e.g., Firewalls, Encryption). |
| **🔒 Physical** | **Real World** | Mechanisms to separate people from systems (e.g., Fences, Locks, Guards). |

---

## **2. Functional Security Controls (The "Why")**
Controls are also categorized by their **function** or time of application.

| Control Function | Goal | Description & Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🛑 Preventive** | **Stop it** | Stops unauthorized activity *before* it happens.<br>*Ex: Firewalls, User Privileges.* |
| **⚠️ Deterrent** | **Discourage it** | Discourages attackers but cannot physically stop them.<br>*Ex: Warning signs, lighting.* |
| **🔍 Detective** | **See it** | Identifies/alerts on a breach *after* or *during* occurrence.<br>*Ex: Surveillance cameras, IDS, Motion detectors.* |
| **🛠️ Corrective** | **Fix it** | Restores systems to a secure state *after* a threat.<br>*Ex: Antivirus (removes malware), Mantraps, Updating policies.* |
| **♻️ Recovery** | **Restore it** | Advanced capabilities to repair damage and restore resources.<br>*Ex: Data Backups, Server Clustering, Fault Tolerance.* |
| **🔄 Compensative** | **Substitute** | An alternative control used when the ideal control isn't possible.<br>*Ex: Using an encrypted VPN to protect legacy clear-text traffic.* |

> [!example] **Practical Examples**
> *   **Preventive:** Assigning specific user privileges.
> *   **Detective:** Cameras inside a server room.
> *   **Corrective:** Installing new antivirus software.
> *   **Recovery:** A comprehensive cloud backup regime.
> *   **Compensative:** Encrypting HTTP traffic via VPN (because the app can't do HTTPS).

## **3. Controls & Compliance**
**CIS (Center for Internet Security)** provides guidance on mapping controls to frameworks.

*   **CIS Controls:** A set of 18 critical security controls.
*   **Mapping:** CIS maps these controls to major frameworks like **NIST**, **PCI DSS**, **HIPAA**, and **ISO 27001**.
*   **CIS-CAT Pro:** A tool that helps assess compliance against these frameworks.
