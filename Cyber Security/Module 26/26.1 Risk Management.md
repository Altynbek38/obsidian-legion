# 🛡️ Risk Management

## **1. Core Concepts**

*   **Risk:** The **probability** of loss due to a threat (malicious act or unexpected event).
*   **Risk Impact:** The **damage** incurred by an event (asset loss or service disruption).
*   **Goal:** To reduce threats to an **acceptable level** and implement controls to maintain that level.
*   **Scope:** Risks can be **Internal** or **External**.

> [!important] **The Golden Rule**
> The cost of a countermeasure should **not** exceed the value of the asset being protected.

## **2. Levels of Care & Risk**

The approach an organization takes determines its risk level.

| Level | Definition | Risk Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Negligence** | No actions or controls are taken. | **Very High** (Catastrophic loss possible). |
| **Due Care** | Taking **reasonable steps** to lower potential loss. | **Lower Risk** (Risk still exists). |
| **Due Diligence** | Taking steps to **eliminate** risk; implementing **multiple controls**. | **Acceptable Risk**. |

## **3. The Risk Management Process**
A formal process to measure impact and implement controls.

### **Phase 1: Frame the Risk**
*   **Identify** threats throughout the organization.
*   *Examples:* Loss of products, service disruption, reputation harm, legal liability.

### **Phase 2: Assess the Risk**
*   Analyze severity and prioritize.
*   **Quantitative Analysis:** Prioritize by actual **financial** impact ($).
*   **Qualitative Analysis:** Prioritize by **scaled** impact on operations (Low/Med/High).

### **Phase 3: Respond to the Risk**
Develop an action plan. There are 4 main responses:
1.  **Eliminate**
2.  **Mitigate**
3.  **Transfer** (e.g., Insurance)
4.  **Accept**

### **Phase 4: Monitor the Risk**
*   Continuously review risk reductions.
*   **Risk Register:** A software or cloud service used to record details about identified risks, controls, and response strategies.
