# 17.2.1: The 14 Domains of Cloud Security (CSA)

The **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)** provides a widely respected framework that breaks down cloud security into 14 distinct domains. This provides a comprehensive checklist for securing a cloud environment.

| Domain | Core Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Cloud Computing Concepts & Architectures** | Defines the fundamental concepts, terminology, and architecture of cloud computing. |
| **2. Governance & Enterprise Risk Management** | Manages overall organizational risk, governance policies, and information security strategy in the cloud. |
| **3. Legal Issues, Contracts & eDiscovery** | Handles legal aspects, provider contracts, and data discovery requests for litigation. |
| **4. Compliance & Audit Management** | Ensures the cloud environment meets regulatory requirements (like GDPR, HIPAA) and can pass internal/external audits. |
| **5. Information Governance** | Governs how data is used, stored, and managed to align with business and regulatory policies. |
| **6. Management Plane & Business Continuity** | Secures the administrative interfaces (the management plane) and ensures business continuity/disaster recovery (BC/DR) plans are in place. |
| **7. Security as a Service (SecaaS)** | Covers security services that are delivered *from* the cloud (e.g., cloud-based firewalls, identity services). |
| **8. Infrastructure Security** | Secures the core cloud infrastructure, including compute (VMs), storage, and networking components. |
| **9. Virtualization & Containers** | Secures the foundational technologies of cloud: hypervisors, virtual machines (VMs), and containers. |
| **10. Incident Response (IR)** | Details the process for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents within a cloud environment. |
| **11. Application Security** | Focuses on building and deploying secure applications, especially in PaaS and IaaS models (DevSecOps). |
| **12. Data Security & Encryption** | Protects the data itself, with a strong focus on encryption (at rest, in transit), access control, and data lifecycle management. |
| **13. Identity, Entitlement & Access (IAM)**| Manages user identities, permissions, and access controls for cloud resources, which differs significantly from traditional on-premise IAM. |
| **14. Related Technologies** | Covers the security of emerging technologies that are closely tied to the cloud (e.g., IoT, Big Data, Serverless Computing). |
