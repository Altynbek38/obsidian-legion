# 17.1.1: Introduction to Virtualization & Cloud

#### Core Concept
*   **Virtualization & Cloud:** The practice of moving applications and data storage away from physical, on-premises hardware into a digital or virtual environment.

#### Key Focus of the Module
*   **Primary Question:** What are the new and unique security risks that arise from using virtualization and the cloud, and what are the strategies to manage and mitigate them?

# 17.1.2: The Virtual Environment

Virtualization reduces the number of physical machines needed by allowing multiple systems to run on a single piece of hardware. This is achieved through several key technologies.

#### Virtual Machines (VMs)
*   **Concept:** A complete, independent operating system (Guest OS) running on top of a physical system (Host).
*   **Key Component:** The **Hypervisor**, which is the software that creates and manages VMs.

*   **Two Types of Hypervisors:**
    *   **Type 1 (Bare-metal):** Runs directly on the physical hardware. *Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V.*
    *   **Type 2 (Hosted):** Runs as an application on top of a host operating system. *Examples: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.*

*   **Security Risk:** **VM Escape.** A compromised VM could potentially break out of its isolated environment and attack the host machine or other VMs. VMs contain full operating systems that must be patched and secured just like a physical machine.

#### Containers
*   **Concept:** A lightweight alternative to VMs. A container packages an application and all its dependencies (libraries, binaries) but **does not** include a full Guest OS. It shares the kernel of the host operating system via a container engine.
*   **Key Technologies:**
    *   **Docker:** The platform for building and running containers.
    *   **Kubernetes:** The platform for managing and orchestrating large numbers of containers.
*   **Security Risk:** **Privilege Escalation.** If an attacker gains root access inside a container, they may be able to compromise the underlying host operating system.

#### VM vs. Container

| Feature | Virtual Machine (VM) | Container |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operating System** | Includes a full, separate Guest OS. | Shares the Host OS kernel. |
| **Size** | Large (Gigabytes). | Small (Megabytes). |
| **Startup Time** | Slow (minutes). | Fast (seconds). |
| **Isolation** | Strong (Hardware-level virtualization).| Weaker (OS-level isolation). |
| **Overhead** | High. | Low. |

#### Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
*   **Concept:** A centralized system where user desktop environments (e.g., Windows 10) are hosted on a server in the data center and streamed to the user's device (often a thin client).
*   **Benefits:** Centralized management, rapid deployment of new desktops, and enhanced security (data remains in the data center, not on the endpoint).
*   **Requirements:** High network availability and significant storage capacity.

# 17.1.3: Disadvantages of Virtual Environments

Virtualization, while beneficial, introduces unique management and security challenges.

#### 1. VM Sprawl
*   **Definition:** A situation where an organization creates too many virtual machines, which are then underutilized, poorly managed, or forgotten.
*   **Consequences:**
    *   **Resource Waste:** These VMs consume valuable CPU, memory, and storage without providing any real benefit.
    *   **Security Risk:** Unmanaged or unpatched "zombie" VMs become a significant security vulnerability, as they are easy targets for attackers.

#### 2. VM Escape
*   **Definition:** A serious security exploit where an attacker "breaks out" of an isolated virtual machine and gains access to the underlying hypervisor or host operating system.
*   **Consequence:** A successful VM escape is a critical breach, as compromising the host gives the attacker potential control over **all** other VMs running on that host.


Of course. This is a review of the fundamental cloud service models. Here are the notes.

# 17.1.4: Cloud-Based Technology

#### Core Concept
*   **Cloud Computing:** Accessing IT resources (computing power, storage, software, servers) over the internet instead of hosting them on-premises. The responsibility for managing the underlying technology shifts from the organization to the cloud provider.
*   **XaaS:** A collective term for these models, meaning "Anything as a Service."

#### The Three Main Cloud Service Models

| Service Model | What You Get | You Manage... | Provider Manages... | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IaaS**<br>(Infrastructure as a Service) | **Virtual Hardware**<br>(VMs, storage, networking) | The OS, middleware, applications, and data. | The physical data center (servers, power, cooling). | Renting an empty plot of land. You build your own house. |
| **PaaS**<br>(Platform as a Service) | **A Development Platform**<br>(Tools, services, database engines) | Your application code and data. | The infrastructure, OS, and middleware. | Renting a fully-equipped workshop. You bring your project. |
| **SaaS**<br>(Software as a Service) | **A Ready-to-Use Application**<br>(Accessed via a web browser) | Your user data and configurations within the app. | **Everything:** Infrastructure, OS, and the application itself. | Renting a fully-furnished apartment. You just move in. |

# 17.1.5: Cloud Computing Deployment Models

This section classifies cloud computing based on the **deployment model**—who owns and manages the infrastructure, and who can access it.

| Deployment Model | Description / Who Hosts It? | Key Characteristics & Trade-offs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Private Cloud** | Infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises ("enterprise cloud") or by a third party. | **Pros:** Maximum control over data and security. <br> **Cons:** Highest cost, full management responsibility. |
| **Public Cloud** | Services are provided over the public internet by a third-party vendor (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Resources are shared among multiple organizations ("multi-tenancy"). | **Pros:** Lower cost (pay-as-you-go), high scalability, no hardware maintenance. <br> **Cons:** Less control over data, potential shared security risks. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | A combination of private and public cloud services, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. | **Pros:** Flexibility (best of both worlds). Keep sensitive data in the private cloud while leveraging the public cloud for scalability and cost-savings. <br> **Cons:** More complex to manage and secure. |
| **Community Cloud**| Infrastructure is shared by several organizations with common concerns (e.g., specific security requirements, compliance, industry standards). | **Pros:** Costs are shared among members, tailored to the specific needs of an industry (e.g., healthcare, finance). <br> **Cons:** Less common, requires collaboration between organizations. |

# 17.1.7: Top Threats to Cloud Computing

#### Core Concept
Cloud environments are vulnerable to many traditional network threats, but they also introduce unique risks. An attacker who compromises a cloud resource can abuse the provider's infrastructure and reputation to:
*   Launch DDoS attacks.
*   Host malware on a seemingly legitimate platform.
*   Send spam and conduct phishing campaigns.

---
#### Key Cloud-Specific Threats

| Threat | Description / Risk |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Breaches** | Unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive, protected data stored in the cloud. |
| **Cloud Misconfiguration** | Incorrectly configured cloud resources (e.g., public storage buckets, overly permissive firewall rules) that leave them vulnerable to attack. This is one of the most common causes of cloud breaches. |
| **Poor Security Architecture** | Failure to properly understand and implement the **shared responsibility model**, leading to security gaps between what the provider secures and what the customer is responsible for securing. |
| **Compromised Credentials** | Attackers stealing user or service account credentials. A compromised high-privilege account (like a root or service account) can give an attacker full control over all cloud resources. |
| **Insider Threat** | A current or former employee, contractor, or partner who intentionally or unintentionally misuses their authorized access to compromise cloud security. |
| **Insecure UI or API** | Vulnerabilities in the web-based user interfaces (UIs) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used to manage cloud services. Since these are publicly exposed, they are a primary target for attackers. |
| **Limited Cloud Visibility** | Lack of visibility into cloud operations, making it difficult for the customer to monitor for threats, identify malicious activity, or audit their environment effectively. |
