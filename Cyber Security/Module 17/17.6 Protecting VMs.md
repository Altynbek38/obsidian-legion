# 17.6.1: Protecting Virtual Machines

#### Core Concept
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a full-fledged computer running a complete operating system. Therefore, it must be secured with the same fundamental best practices as any physical server or workstation.

---
#### VM Security Best Practices

| Security Best Practice | Description / Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network Segmentation** | Place VMs in appropriate subnets (VPCs) to restrict their access. Only give a VM the network connectivity it absolutely needs (e.g., place a database in a private subnet with no internet access). |
| **System Hardening** | Reduce the attack surface by disabling all non-essential ports, services, and software on the VM's operating system. |
| **Secure Account Management** | Disable or remove all default user accounts. Enforce strong password policies and apply the **principle of least privilege**, giving users only the permissions they need to perform their jobs. |
| **Install Antimalware** | Install and regularly update antivirus/antimalware software inside the VM's OS. Alternatively, use cloud-native security services if the provider offers them. |
| **Use Host-Based Security** | Enable and configure the VM's built-in host-based firewall (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall, iptables). Consider using host-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) as well. |

# 17.6.2: Protecting VMs from VM Sprawl

#### What is VM Sprawl?
The uncontrolled creation of numerous virtual machines that are not properly managed, often left running after they are no longer needed (e.g., after a project or testing phase).

---
#### Why is it a Problem?

*   **Security Risk:** Unmanaged VMs are not monitored or patched. They become outdated "zombie" servers, creating significant vulnerabilities that attackers can easily exploit.
*   **Cost Waste:** These abandoned VMs continue to consume and incur costs for cloud resources (compute instances, storage, public IPs) without providing any business value.

---
#### How to Mitigate It
The solution is to implement strong governance and management policies for cloud resources.

*   **Log & Monitor:** Keep detailed logs of all cloud resource usage to track who is creating what.
*   **Audit Regularly:** Periodically review all running VMs to verify they are still necessary and properly maintained.
*   **Enforce Decommissioning:** Establish a clear process for shutting down and deleting VMs that are no longer in use.
