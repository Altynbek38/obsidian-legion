# 17.5.1: The Three States of Data

To properly secure data, it must be protected in each of its three possible states. Encryption and hashing are the primary tools used, but they are applied differently depending on the state.

| State of Data | Description | Examples | Primary Security Control |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data at Rest** | Data that is stored and is not actively being accessed or transmitted. | Files on a hard drive, data in a database, backups on tape, cloud storage (S3 buckets). | **Encryption at Rest** (e.g., Full Disk Encryption, database encryption, file-level encryption). |
| **Data in Transit** | Data that is actively moving from one location to another across a network. | Traffic over a local network, data sent over the internet, communication between VMs. | **Encryption in Transit** (e.g., TLS/SSL for HTTPS, IPsec for VPNs, SSH). |
| **Data in Process** <br> (or Data in Use) | Data that is actively being processed by an application, loaded into RAM, or used by the CPU. | Performing calculations on a spreadsheet, data being modified by an application, information being sorted in memory. | **Secure Processing Environments** (e.g., strong access controls, memory protection, secure coding practices). |

> **Note:** Protecting **Data in Process** is often the most challenging, as the data must typically be unencrypted for the CPU to work with it. Security here relies on protecting the runtime environment itself.

# 17.5.2: Cryptography

#### Core Concepts
*   **Cryptography:** The science of creating and breaking secret codes to protect information.
*   **Encryption:** The process of converting readable data (**plaintext**) into an unreadable, scrambled format (**ciphertext**).
*   **Decryption:** The process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
*   **Key:** A secret piece of information (like a password or digital file) that is required to encrypt and/or decrypt the data.

#### The Two Classes of Encryption Algorithms

| Feature | Symmetric Encryption | Asymmetric Encryption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key Usage** | Uses a **single, pre-shared key** for both encryption and decryption. | Uses **two different keys** (a key pair) – one for encryption, one for decryption. |
| **Also Known As** | Private Key Encryption | Public Key Encryption |
| **Key Example(s)** | **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** <br> *(Used by the U.S. government; has key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits)* | **RSA**, Diffie-Hellman, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), ElGamal. |

# 17.5.3: Hashing

#### Core Concept
*   **Hashing:** A one-way function that takes data of any size (the message) and produces a unique, fixed-length string called a **hash value** (or message digest).
*   **Primary Uses:**
    *   **Data Integrity:** Verifying that a file or message has not been altered.
    *   **Authentication:** Securely storing passwords by hashing them instead of storing them in plaintext.

#### Key Properties of a Cryptographic Hash
A secure hash function must have these four properties:

1.  **Variable-length input:** It can process data of any size.
2.  **Fixed-length output:** The resulting hash is always the same length, regardless of the input size.
3.  **One-way function:** It is computationally impossible to reverse the process (i.e., you cannot get the original data from its hash).
4.  **Collision resistant:** Two different inputs should never produce the same hash value.

#### Common Hashing Algorithms

| Algorithm | Status | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MD5** (Message Digest 5) | **Insecure / Deprecated** | Prone to collisions and should no longer be used for security purposes. |
| **SHA-1** (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) | **Deprecated** | Also considered weak and has been phased out of most secure applications. |
| **SHA-2 Family** <br> (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) | **Secure / Recommended** | The current industry standard for hashing. SHA-256 is the most widely used variant. |
