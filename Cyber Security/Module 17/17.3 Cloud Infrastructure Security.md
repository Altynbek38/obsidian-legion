# 17.3.1: Infrastructure Security

#### Core Concept
This domain focuses on securing the foundational layers of the cloud—both the provider's physical infrastructure and the virtual resources the customer uses.

---
#### The Two Layers of Cloud Infrastructure

1.  **The Physical Layer (Provider's Responsibility):**
    *   The physical servers, storage arrays, and networking hardware that create the cloud's resource pools.

2.  **The Virtual Layer (Customer's Responsibility):**
    *   The virtual machines (compute), virtual networks (VPCs), and storage volumes that the customer creates and manages on top of the physical layer.

---
#### The Shift in Security Approach
*   **Problem:** Traditional security models that rely on physically inserting hardware appliances (like firewalls) into network paths **do not work** in a virtualized cloud environment. You cannot physically plug a firewall between two VMs running on the same server.

#### Cloud-Specific Security Tools
To address this, security is implemented in software:

*   **Virtual Appliances:** Virtualized versions of firewalls, load balancers, and IPS that run as a VM within the cloud environment.
*   **Software Agents:** Security software (like anti-malware or monitoring agents) installed directly within the guest OS of a VM.
*   **Warning:** These software-based tools can create performance bottlenecks or high CPU usage and must be deployed carefully.

---
#### The Role of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
SDN is a key enabler of modern cloud security, providing significant advantages over traditional hardware-based networking.

*   **Micro-segmentation & Isolation:** Easily create isolated virtual networks for different applications without needing any physical hardware changes.
*   **Flexible Firewalling:** Security policies (like **AWS Security Groups** or **Azure Network Security Groups**) can be attached directly to virtual machines, providing granular, stateful firewalling that follows the VM wherever it moves.

# 17.3.2: Cloud Security Responsibilities

#### Core Concept: The Shared Responsibility Model
Cloud security is a partnership. The **Shared Responsibility Model** defines the division of security tasks between the **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)** and the customer (**Client**).

The key principle is: As you move from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, the CSP takes on more responsibility, and the client takes on less.

---
#### Responsibility Breakdown by Service Model

| Security Responsibility     | On-premise | IaaS       | PaaS       | SaaS       |
| :-------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Data**                    | **Client** | **Client** | **Client** | **Client** |
| **Endpoints**               | Client     | Client     | Client     | Shared     |
| **Identity Management**     | Client     | Client     | Shared     | Shared     |
| **Application**             | Client     | Client     | Shared     | CSP        |
| **Network Control**         | Client     | Client     | Shared     | CSP        |
| **Operating System**        | Client     | Client     | CSP        | CSP        |
| **Physical Infrastructure** | Client     | CSP        | CSP        | CSP        |

---
#### Key Takeaways

*   **The Golden Rule:** The customer is **ALWAYS** responsible for the security of their own **data**.
*   **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** The CSP secures the physical cloud infrastructure. The customer is responsible for securing everything they put *in* the cloud, including the operating system, applications, network controls, and data.
*   **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** The CSP manages the underlying platform (OS, middleware). The customer is responsible for securing their **application code** and their **data**.
*   **SaaS (Software as a Service):** The CSP manages and secures almost everything. The customer is primarily responsible for managing **user access** and **securing their data** within the application.

# 17.3.3: Other Cloud Infrastructure Security Considerations

#### Company Security Policies & Shadow IT
*   **Problem:** **"Shadow IT"** - Employees using un-sanctioned, unmonitored cloud apps and software tools.
*   **Risk:** Creates security blind spots and vulnerabilities, as these apps are not managed or vetted by the IT department.
*   **Solution:** Implement strong, well-defined company security policies combined with user education to control the use of unapproved applications.

---
#### Layered Security (Defense in Depth) in the Cloud
Applying security at multiple layers is crucial. Key cloud security controls include:

*   **Built-in Provider Security:** Leverage the security services provided by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP), such as built-in DDoS protection.
*   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Create logically isolated private networks within the public cloud to segregate your resources from the internet and from other tenants.
*   **Virtual Firewalls / Security Groups:** Use software-based firewalls (like AWS Security Groups or Azure NSGs) to apply stateful allow/deny rules directly to virtual machines and resources.
*   **Flow Logs:** Monitor the network traffic that flows to and from your virtual network interfaces for security analysis and troubleshooting.
*   **VPNs:** Securely connect remote users to the cloud (client-to-site VPN) or connect your on-premises data center to the cloud (site-to-site VPN).
*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** **CRITICAL** for security. Properly configure IAM to manage user identities, authentication, and authorization, ensuring the principle of least privilege is followed.

---
#### Microsegmentation
*   **Definition:** A security technique that breaks the cloud network into many small, granular, isolated segments, down to the individual workload level.
*   **How it Works:** It uses virtual networking (SDN) to create these zones in software, without needing physical hardware.
*   **Benefit:** Provides extremely granular security control. By isolating every application or VM, it dramatically reduces the attack surface and prevents **lateral movement**—an attacker who compromises one machine cannot easily move to others.
