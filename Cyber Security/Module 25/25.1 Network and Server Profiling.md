# 📊 Network and Server Profiling

## **1. Network Profiling**
To detect security incidents, you must first understand **normal** behavior.
*   **Baselining:** Creating a statistical reference point for normal network function.
*   **Sliding Window:** A method to ensure the baseline is current by defining a specific time window and dropping out-of-date data.

**Indicators of Compromise (IoC):**
*   Increased WAN utilization at unusual times (Data exfiltration).
*   Hosts accessing obscure internet servers.
*   Lateral movement (Client-to-Client traffic).

**Tools:** `NetFlow`, `Wireshark`, `Cisco ISE` (for user behavior).

### **Network Profile Elements**

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Session Duration** | Time between the start and end of a data flow. |
| **Total Throughput** | Amount of data passing from source to destination in a specific time. |
| **Ports Used** | List of TCP/UDP ports available to accept data. |
| **Critical Asset Address Space** | IP addresses/Logical locations of essential systems (High Value Targets). |

## **2. Server Profiling**
Establishing the **accepted operating state** of a specific server.

### **Server Profile Elements**

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Listening Ports** | TCP/UDP daemons/ports allowed to be open. |
| **Logged-in Users** | Parameters defining user access and behavior. |
| **Service Accounts** | Definitions of service types an application is allowed to run. |
| **Software Environment** | Tasks, processes, and applications permitted to run. |

## **3. Network Anomaly Detection (NBA)**
**Network Behavior Analysis (NBA)** uses "Big Data" analytics to detect attacks in unstructured data.

*   **Statistical / Machine Learning:** Compares current traffic against the **baseline**. Significant deviations = Alarm.
*   **Rule-Based:** Analyzes packets based on **pre-defined patterns** (signatures).

> [!example] **Scenario**
> If a border router sees packet flows exceed a specific threshold (e.g., >500 flows) within a specific time window, an **Alarm** is triggered.

## **4. Network Vulnerability Testing**
Periodic testing is essential for internet-facing services.

| Test Type | Description | Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Analysis** | Evaluates the **likelihood** and **impact** of attacks on core assets. | Risk Management Frameworks. |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | **Scans** for weaknesses (missing patches, open ports, web-facing flaws). Does **not** exploit them. | `OpenVAS`, `Nessus`, `Qualys`, `Nmap`. |
| **Penetration Testing** | **Simulated attacks**. Actually **exploits** vulnerabilities to determine the depth of the breach. | `Metasploit`, `CORE Impact`. |
