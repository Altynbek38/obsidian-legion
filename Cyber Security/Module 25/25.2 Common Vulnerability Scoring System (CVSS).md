# 📊 Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

## **1. Overview**
**CVSS** is a vendor-neutral, open framework used to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities.
*   **Manager:** Maintained by **FIRST** (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams).
*   **Goal:** Provides a standardized numeric score (0-10) to help organizations **prioritize** risks.

## **2. The Three Metric Groups**

| Metric Group | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🛡️ Base** | Characteristics that are **constant** over time and across all environments. (Vendor set). |
| **⏳ Temporal** | Characteristics that **change over time** (e.g., Exploit code maturity, patch availability). |
| **🌍 Environmental** | Characteristics specific to the **user's environment** (e.g., specific hardware configurations). |

> **Formula:** Base + Temporal + Environmental = **Final Score**.

## **3. Base Metric Group (The Core)**
The Base group determines the foundational severity. It is divided into **Exploitability** (The Attack) and **Impact** (The Damage).

### **A. Exploitability Metrics**
*How hard is it to hack?*

| Metric | Code | Criteria | Values (Examples) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attack Vector** | **AV** | **Proximity** of the attacker to the target. (Remote is worse than Physical). | **N** (Network), **A** (Adjacent), **L** (Local), **P** (Physical). |
| **Attack Complexity** | **AC** | **Conditions** beyond attacker's control required for success. | **L** (Low), **H** (High). |
| **Privileges Required**| **PR** | **Access level** required before the attack. | **N** (None), **L** (Low), **H** (High). |
| **User Interaction** | **UI** | Does a user need to do something (click a link)? | **N** (None), **R** (Required). |
| **Scope** | **S** | Does the exploit impact resources beyond the vulnerable component (Change of Authority)? | **U** (Unchanged), **C** (Changed). |

### **B. Impact Metrics (CIA Triad)**
*What happens if hacked?*

| Metric | Code | Description | Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confidentiality** | **C** | Impact on limiting access to authorized users. | High / Low / None |
| **Integrity** | **I** | Impact on trustworthiness/authenticity of data. | High / Low / None |
| **Availability** | **A** | Impact on accessibility of resources. | High / Low / None |

## **4. The Vector String**
A text string used to share results easily. It summarizes the metric choices.

> [!example] **Vector String Example**
> `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N`
> *   **AV:N** = Attack Vector: Network
> *   **PR:H** = Privileges Required: High
> *   **UI:N** = User Interaction: None

## **5. Severity Ratings**

| Severity | CVSS Score | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **None** | **0.0** | No action needed. |
| **Low** | **0.1 – 3.9** | Monitor. |
| **Medium** | **4.0 – 6.9** | Address routinely. |
| **High** | **7.0 – 8.9** | **Urgent remediation.** |
| **Critical** | **9.0 – 10.0** | **Emergency.** Immediate action required. |

> **Rule of Thumb:** Any vulnerability > **3.9** should be addressed.

## **6. Related Information Sources**
CVSS works in tandem with these US-based systems:

| Source | Managed By | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CVE** | **MITRE** | **Dictionary.** A list of common names (IDs) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `CVE-2021-44228`). |
| **NVD** | **NIST** | **Database.** Uses CVE IDs and adds **CVSS scores**, technical details, and patch links. |
