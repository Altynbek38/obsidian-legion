# 📝 Endpoint Vulnerability Assessment Summary

## **1. Network & Server Profiling**
**Profiling** creates a statistical **baseline** of normal behavior to help detect anomalies.

*   **Network Profile Elements:** Session duration, Total throughput, Ports used, Critical asset address space.
*   **Server Profile:** Establishes accepted parameters for network, users, and applications on a specific server.
*   **Analysis:** Uses **Big Data analytics** for Statistical, Behavioral, and Rule-based anomaly detection.

### **Evaluation Methods**
| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Analysis** | Evaluating risk posed by vulnerabilities to a specific organization. |
| **Vuln. Assessment** | Scanning internet-facing servers and internal networks for weaknesses. |
| **Penetration Test** | Authorized **simulated attacks** to test security strength. |

## **2. CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**
A vendor-neutral, open framework for rating the severity of vulnerabilities (0-10 scale).

### **Metric Groups**
1.  **🛡️ Base:** Constant attributes (Attack Vector, Complexity, Privileges, User Interaction, Scope).
2.  **⏳ Temporal:** Changes over time (e.g., exploit maturity).
3.  **🌍 Environmental:** Specific to the organization's context.

### **Severity Ratings**
| Rating | Score Range | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | **9.0 - 10.0** | Emergency Remediation |
| **High** | **7.0 - 8.9** | Urgent Remediation |
| **Medium** | **4.0 - 6.9** | Address Routinely |
| **Low** | **0.1 - 3.9** | Monitor |
| **None** | **0.0** | No Action |

> [!important] **Threshold**
> Any vulnerability exceeding **3.9** should be addressed.

*   **CVE:** Dictionary of common names/IDs.
*   **NVD:** National Vulnerability Database (includes scores).

## **3. Secure Device Management**

### **Risk Response Strategies**
| Response | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Avoidance** | **Discontinue** the activity/service (Risk is too high). |
| **Reduction** | Take measures to **mitigate/limit** impact. |
| **Sharing** | **Outsource** or use insurance. |
| **Retention** | **Accept** the risk (take no action). |

### **Management Practices**
*   **Vulnerability Mgmt Cycle:** Discover $\rightarrow$ Prioritize $\rightarrow$ Assess $\rightarrow$ Report $\rightarrow$ Remediate $\rightarrow$ Verify.
*   **Asset Management:** Tracking location/config of all devices (Physical & Logical).
*   **MDM (Mobile Device Mgmt):** Cloud-based configuration and monitoring for diverse mobile clients.
*   **Configuration Mgmt:** Inventory and control of HW/SW settings.

### **Patch Management**
Required by compliance regulations. Techniques include:
*   **Agent-based:** Software on host installs patches.
*   **Agentless:** Server scans and pushes patches.
*   **Passive Monitoring:** Traffic analysis to detect versions.
