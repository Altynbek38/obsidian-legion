# 🔒 Secure Device Management

## **1. Risk Management**
Risk Management is an ongoing, cyclical process of selecting and specifying security controls.

### **The Risk Formula**
$$Risk = Threat \times Vulnerability \times Asset\ Value$$
*(Contextualized by the nature of the organization)*

### **The Cycle**
1.  **Identify:** Assets, Vulnerabilities, Threats.
2.  **Assess:** Score, weigh, and prioritize risks (T-V Pairing).
3.  **Plan:** Determine response.
4.  **Implement:** execute the response.
5.  **Monitor:** Continuous assessment.

### **Risk Response Strategies**
| Strategy | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Avoidance** | **Stop** the risky activity entirely. | Discontinue a specific business function. |
| **Reduction** | **Decrease** risk by reducing vulnerability. | Patching servers, implementing firewalls. |
| **Sharing** | **Shift** risk to a third party. | Insurance, outsourcing to SECaaS. |
| **Retention** | **Accept** the risk and consequences. | Low impact risks or risks too expensive to fix. |

## **2. Vulnerability Management**
A proactive practice to prevent exploitation.

**Life Cycle:**
1.  **Discover:** Inventory assets & scan for vulnerabilities.
2.  **Prioritize Assets:** Categorize by business value/criticality.
3.  **Assess:** Determine baseline risk profile.
4.  **Report:** Document security plan & risks.
5.  **Remediate:** Fix vulnerabilities based on priority.
6.  **Verify:** Audit to ensure threats are eliminated.

## **3. Asset Management**
You cannot protect what you don't know you have.
*   **Goal:** Track location, configuration, and state of all networked devices and software.
*   **Process:** Automated discovery $\rightarrow$ Compare to Desired State $\rightarrow$ Fix Discrepancies.

---

## **4. Mobile Device Management (MDM)**
Managing devices that leave the physical premises (BYOD challenges).
*   **Risks:** Loss, theft, tampering, untrusted networks.
*   **Controls:** Remote wipe, encryption, robust authentication, cloud-based configuration (e.g., Cisco Meraki).
*   **Rule:** Assume all mobile devices are **untrusted** until secured.

---

## **5. Configuration Management**
Inventory and control of HW/SW configurations to maintain integrity.
*   **Baselines:** Standard images for OS/Hardware to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Network:** Backup configs, bulk changes.
    *   **Cloud/Servers:** `Puppet`, `Chef`, `Ansible`, `SaltStack` (Infrastructure as Code).

---

## **6. Enterprise Patch Management**
Identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying software updates.
*   **Compliance:** Required by **SOX**, **HIPAA**.
*   **Tools:** `SolarWinds`, `SCCM` (Microsoft).

### **Patching Techniques**

| Technique | Description | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent-Based** | Software agent on host pulls/installs patches. | **Mobile devices** & roaming laptops. |
| **Agentless** | Server scans network and pushes patches. | Static devices on the LAN. |
| **Passive Monitor** | Monitors traffic to detect software versions. | Apps that broadcast version info. |
