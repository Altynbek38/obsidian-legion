### **Lecture 6: Network Security Design & Technology - Key Notes**

#### **Part 1: Network Operations & Resilience (Being Prepared)**

*   **Plan for Failure (Redundancy):**
    *   Service continuity is key. Don't just have one backup device; have a plan for when the backup also fails.
    *   **Hot Redundancy:** An automatic, live backup system that takes over instantly.
    *   **Cold Redundancy:** A spare device kept in storage, ready to be manually configured and deployed when needed.
    *   **Key Principle:** Engineers should describe the risks and costs of different options, but **management makes the final business decision** on how much risk is acceptable.

*   **Emergency Access & Documentation:**
    *   **Out-of-Band Management:** You MUST have a way to access your network equipment (like a console port) that **does not depend on the main network being operational**. If the network goes down, you still need to be able to log in and fix it.
    *   **Emergency Document:** Create a document with critical information (how to contact vendors, how to get console access, etc.) and save it **locally** on engineers' computers, not just on a network drive that might be unavailable during an outage.

*   **Key Operational Processes:**
    *   **Logging:** Review logs daily. Use scripts to filter out routine noise and highlight critical alerts.
    *   **Change Control:** Have a formal process for making changes to the network to prevent accidental outages.
    *   **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date network diagrams and label all physical ports. **Shut down all unused ports** as a basic security measure.

#### **Part 2: Core Security Devices: The Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**

An NGFW is a modern, intelligent firewall that goes far beyond simple port blocking. Its key features are essential for a high level of protection.

*   **Stateful Firewalling:** The basic function. It tracks the state of active network connections and only allows traffic that is part of a legitimate session.
*   **Application Firewalling (Layer 7 Awareness):** Can identify and control traffic based on the specific **application** (e.g., block Facebook but allow Salesforce), not just the port number.
*   **Threat Prevention:** Includes integrated security services like:
    *   **Antivirus/Anti-spyware:** Scans traffic for known malware.
    *   **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Detects and blocks known network attack patterns.
*   **URL Filtering:** Blocks access to malicious or unauthorized websites based on their category (e.g., gambling, malware).
*   **File/Data Filtering:** Blocks specific file types (like `.exe` files) from being downloaded or can prevent sensitive data patterns (like credit card numbers) from leaving the network.

#### **Part 3: Secure Network Design: Data Center vs. Office**

The security priorities for a data center and an office are different.

*   **Data Center Design:**
    *   **Top Priorities:** High Availability, Performance, and Reliability.
    *   **Key Security Strategy:** **Segmentation**. This means dividing the network into logical zones (e.g., Web Server Zone, Database Zone, Management Zone) and placing firewalls between them to control traffic flow. An attack in one zone should not be able to spread to another.

*   **Office Network Design:**
    *   **Top Priorities:** Balancing security with user-friendliness and cost.
    *   **Biggest Risk:** The probability of **internal threats** (whether accidental or malicious) is much higher than in a data center.
    *   **Two Main Security Tasks:**
        1.  Protect company resources **FROM** the users (e.g., prevent malware on a user's laptop from spreading to a server).
        2.  Protect the users **FROM** themselves and the internet (e.g., block phishing sites).

#### **Part 4: The Modern Security Model: Zero Trust**

Zero Trust is a fundamental shift in how we think about network security.

*   **The Old Model ("Perimeter Defense"):**
    *   "Trust but verify." The network had a hard, secure outer shell (the perimeter firewall).
    *   Anything **inside** the network was considered "trusted," and anything **outside** was "untrusted."

*   **The New Model ("Zero Trust"):**
    *   **"Never trust, always verify."**
    *   The perimeter is gone. With cloud services, remote workers (VPN), and personal devices (BYOD), you can no longer assume the internal network is safe.
    *   **Core Principle:** Assume the network is already compromised. Every user, device, and application must be strictly **authenticated and authorized** before being granted access to any resource, every single time. Location (inside vs. outside) does not equal trust.

*   **Host Checking (A Zero Trust Example):**
    *   Before allowing a remote user's laptop to connect via VPN, the system automatically **checks the device's security posture**.
    *   It verifies that the device has the correct OS version, up-to-date antivirus, and a running firewall. If the device fails the check, it is denied access, preventing a compromised home computer from infecting the corporate network.

***
**Key Takeaway for Your Midterm:**
1.  The modern security philosophy is **Zero Trust**: never trust, always verify.
2.  A **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)** is a critical security device that provides application-level control and threat prevention.
3.  Network design must be tailored to the environment: **Data Centers** prioritize segmentation and availability, while **Office Networks** focus on managing internal threats and user access.
