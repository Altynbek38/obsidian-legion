### **Lecture 2: Malware & Social Engineering - Key Notes**

#### **Part 1: Social Engineering (SE) - The Art of Human Hacking**

*   **What is Social Engineering?**
    *   It is the psychological manipulation of people to trick them into performing actions or giving away sensitive information.
    *   It's a **non-technical attack** that relies on human interaction, not on hacking systems directly. It targets people, not computers.

*   **Why It Works: Exploiting Human Psychology**
    *   Social engineering bypasses technical defenses by appealing to human **instincts and emotions** over logical reasoning.
    *   Attackers exploit common human tendencies like:
        *   **Fear & Urgency:** Creating panic so the victim acts without thinking (e.g., "Your account has been compromised, click here NOW!").
        *   **Trust & Authority:** Pretending to be someone important, like a manager, IT support, or a bank official.
        *   **Greed & Curiosity:** Offering something that is too good to be true (e.g., a free gift card, a secret document).
        *   **Helpfulness & Pity:** Posing as a new employee or someone in trouble to gain sympathy and help.
        *   **Guilt:** Making you feel like you owe them something.

*   **Who Uses Social Engineering?**
    *   **Blackhat Hackers:** For malicious purposes like theft or disruption.
    *   **Whitehat Hackers (Pentesters):** To test a company's defenses and find weaknesses.
    *   **Industrial Spies:** To steal competitor secrets.

#### **Part 2: The Social Engineering Attack Cycle**

An attack typically follows four main stages:

1.  **Information Gathering (Reconnaissance):** The attacker researches the target (a person or company) to find useful information like employee names, job titles, email formats, and internal jargon.
2.  **Scenario Preparation:** The attacker develops a believable story (a "pretext") and prepares the attack method (e.g., crafts a fake email, creates a malicious website).
3.  **Establish Trust:** The attacker makes contact with the victim and uses their story and psychological tricks to gain trust.
4.  **Execution:** The attacker convinces the victim to perform the desired action (click a link, give a password, transfer money, install malware).

#### **Part 3: Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks**

*   **Phishing:**
    *   The most common type. Uses fake emails, messages, or websites to trick victims into entering their credentials (username/password) or other sensitive data.
    *   **Trick:** Attackers often use slightly misspelled domains (e.g., `exanplebank.kz` instead of `examplebank.kz`).

*   **Spear Phishing:**
    *   A highly targeted phishing attack aimed at a specific person or organization. The message is personalized using gathered information to make it seem more legitimate.

*   **Vishing (Voice Phishing):**
    *   Phishing that happens over the phone. An attacker calls and pretends to be from IT support, a bank, or law enforcement to trick the victim.
    *   **Example:** "Hi, this is Arthur from security. You need to install this software update immediately to protect against a virus. I'm sending you the link now."

*   **Baiting & Malicious Attachments:**
    *   Tricking a victim into downloading and running malware.
    *   This is often done through email attachments (.xlsm, .exe files) or by leaving infected USB drives in public places for someone to find and plug in.

#### **Part 4: Malware Basics**

*   **What is Malware?**
    *   Malicious software designed to disrupt computer operations, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.

*   **How Malware Spreads (Entry Routes):**
    *   Phishing emails with malicious links or attachments.
    *   Downloading applications from unreliable sources.
    *   Visiting malicious or hacked websites.
    *   Infected USB drives and external hard disks.

*   **Signs of a Malware Infection:**
    *   Computer running very slowly.
    *   Suspicious pop-up ads appearing.
    *   Browser redirecting to unknown websites.
    *   Files appearing or disappearing without your action.
    *   System crashing frequently.

#### **Part 5: What to Do if You Suspect an Infection**

1.  **Disconnect from the Internet** to prevent the malware from spreading or sending out your data.
2.  **Run a full system scan** using a reliable antivirus program.
3.  **Remove** any suspicious files or applications.
4.  **Reset all your important passwords** (email, banking, social media) from a DIFFERENT, clean computer.
5.  **Reset your browser** to its default settings.
6.  **Report the incident** to your IT/security department if it's a work computer.

**Key Takeaway for Your Midterm:**
Social engineering is a major threat because it targets the **human element** of security, which is often the weakest link. Technology alone cannot protect against an employee who is tricked into giving away their password.
