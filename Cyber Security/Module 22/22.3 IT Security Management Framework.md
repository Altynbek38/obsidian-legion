# **IT Security Management Framework**

# ISO/IEC 27000 Series
**ISO 27000** is a comprehensive set of standards for **Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)**. Unlike the OSI model (which uses layers), this is a **peer model** consisting of 12 independent domains that interact with each other.

### **The Twelve Domains**

| Domain | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Risk Assessment** | Determines quantitative and qualitative value of risk (1st step in risk management). |
| **Security Policy** | Specifies constraints, behaviors, and data access rules. |
| **Organization of InfoSec** | The governance model for information security. |
| **Asset Management** | Inventory and classification of information assets. |
| **HR Security** | Procedures for employees joining, moving, or leaving. |
| **Physical/Environmental** | Protection of facilities and hardware. |
| **Comms & Ops Management** | Technical controls for systems and networks. |
| **Systems Acquisition/Dev** | Integrating security into the lifecycle of systems/software. |
| **Access Control** | Restricting access rights to prevent unauthorized use. |
| **Incident Management** | Anticipation and response to breaches. |
| **Business Continuity** | Maintaining/recovering critical activities after disruption. |
| **Compliance** | Ensuring conformance with laws, standards, and regulations. |

# Controls & Objectives

| Standard | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ISO 27001** | **Control Objectives** | Defines **high-level requirements**. Acts as a checklist for ISMS audits. Passing this creates trust with partners. |
| **ISO 27002** | **Controls** | Defines **how** to accomplish objectives. Guidelines for implementation. Vendor-neutral. |

> **Note:** Organizations use a **Statement of Applicability (SOA)** to tailor controls to their specific priorities regarding the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
> *   *Example:* Google prioritizes Confidentiality/Availability. Amazon prioritizes Availability above all.

### **Data States & Responsibilities**
ISO controls address data in three states. Different teams handle different states:
1.  **In Process:** Programmers / Data Entry.
2.  **At Rest (Storage):** Hardware Support / Storage Admins.
3.  **In Transit:** Network Security Teams.

# Other Frameworks

### **NIST Cybersecurity Workforce Framework**
Organizes cybersecurity work into 7 categories to help with recruitment and job definition:
*   **Operate & Maintain:** Support/Admin/Performance.
*   **Protect & Defend:** Analyze and mitigate internal threats.
*   **Investigate:** Cyber events and attacks.
*   **Collect & Operate:** Denial, deception, and intel collection.
*   **Analyze:** Review incoming info for intelligence value.
*   **Oversee & Govern:** Leadership and advocacy.
*   **Securely Provision:** Design and build secure systems.

### **CIS Critical Security Controls**
Developed by the **Center for Internet Security** to help organizations improve defense based on available resources.

| Level | Target Audience | Focus Areas |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic** | Limited Resources | Hardware/Software inventory, Vulnerability management, Admin privileges. |
| **Foundational** | Moderate Resources | Malware defense, Recovery, Port control, Boundary defense. |
| **Organizational** | Significant Resources | Penetration testing, Incident response, Security training. |

> **CIS Benchmarks:** Over 100 configuration guides/checklists for securely configuring platforms.

### **Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)**
Developed by the **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)**.
*   A framework mapping cloud-specific controls to leading standards.
*   Contains **197 control objectives** across 17 domains.
*   Considered the de-facto standard for cloud security compliance.

# Compliance & Audits

Service providers use these to prove they are secure:

*   **SSAE 18 / SOC 2:** Independent audit of a service provider's controls.
    *   **Type I:** Point-in-time snapshot.
    *   **Type II:** Managed over a period (min. 6 months).
*   **CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification):**
    *   Required for US Dept. of Defense (DoD) contractors.
    *   5 Levels: Ranges from "Basic Cyber Hygiene" to "Advanced/Progressive" (defense against APTs).
