# **Governance**

**IT Security Governance** determines *who* is authorized to make decisions about cybersecurity risks. It ensures risks are mitigated, strategies align with business goals, and the organization remains compliant with regulations.

*   **Governance vs. Management:**
    *   **Governance:** Oversight, decision-making authority, and accountability.
    *   **Management:** Defines and implements the actual controls to mitigate risks.

# Data Governance Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Owner** | Ensures compliance, assigns data classification, and determines access criteria. |
| **Data Controller** | Determines the **purpose** and method of processing personal data. |
| **Data Processor** | An entity that processes data *on behalf* of the controller. |
| **Data Custodian** | Responsible for **technical control**; implements security controls defined by the Data Owner. |
| **Data Steward** | Ensures data supports business needs and meets regulatory requirements. |
| **Data Protection Officer** | Oversees the organization’s overall data protection strategy. |

# Cybersecurity Policies

A **Cybersecurity Policy** is a high-level document outlining the organization's vision, goals, scope, and responsibilities. It demonstrates commitment to security, sets standards, and defines legal consequences for violations.

**Three Main Policy Levels:**

1.  **Master Cybersecurity Policy:** The strategic blueprint for the entire program.
2.  **System-Specific Policy:** Standards for specific hardware, software, or OS hardening (e.g., standardizing approved apps).
3.  **Issue-Specific Policy:** Detailed requirements for specific operational conditions or issues.

# Common Security Policies

| Policy Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Identification & Authentication** | Specifies who can access resources and the verification procedures required. |
| **Password Policy** | Defines requirements like character types, length, and rotation frequency. |
| **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** | Rules for using network resources and consequences for violations. |
| **Remote Access Policy** | Rules for connecting to the internal network from outside and what is accessible. |
| **Network Maintenance** | Procedures for updating OS and applications (patching). |
| **Incident Handling** | Guidance on reporting and responding to security incidents. |
| **Data Policy** | Rules for processing, classifying (e.g., Confidential vs. Public), and disposing of data. |
| **Credential Policy** | Rules for composing credentials (e.g., min/max password length). |
| **Organizational Policy** | Guidance on workflows, such as **Change Management** or **Asset Management**. |

# Managing User Threats (HR Context)

HR and IT teams must collaborate to mitigate user domain threats using specific controls:

| Threat Scenario | Recommended Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users clicking phishing emails | Conduct **Security Awareness Training**. |
| Users accessing unnecessary data (e.g., all client files) | Enforce **User Access Controls** (Least Privilege). |
| Downloading unauthorized software | Enable **IDS/IPS Monitoring**. |
| Misusing VPN (e.g., watching movies) | Track and **monitor abnormal employee behavior**. |

> **Note:** As a cybersecurity professional, you possess the same skills as a cybercriminal. **Ethics** is the code of behavior that distinguishes you from them.
